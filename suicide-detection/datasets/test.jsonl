It eventually drove me to the point where I accepted death as a possible way out in situations, of which I would think about daily... It was at that moment that I felt something broke, because since I was around 13 (I'm currently 18) this urge to just end it all, to avoid all future stress, has grown to the point where I'm becoming dangerously close.\nIt's evolved past the point of being linked to depression, or stress, or anxiety. This urge to end everything is becoming completely independent from my emotional state, and I feel it constantly now. \nI've already tried to hang myself a few times, then cry myself to sleep when it didn't work. I used to do it as a way to scare myself back into shape, but the more I do it, the more I realize that in all honesty I just don't want to be alive anymore, and each time I do it I get a little closer to completely losing consciousness and becoming brain dead in that tight, embracing rope.\n\nI guess this is a cry for help. I used to talk to friends about this, but I told everyone that I'm fine now, deep down I know it'd be easier to kill myself if they weren't worried about me...

{"id": "12123", "text": "All the things that no one knows. And I just want it to look like an accidentI feel like I was meant to die young.  That I was always meant to kill myself.  The thoughts of death and hurting myself weren't very frequent at first, but I remember having such terrible feelings even as a child of 7 or 8, of being unloved, hiding under blankets and crying because I felt so out of place and worthless.  It wasn't all the time, just every now and then it would be horrible.  \n\nI was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 20, was put on hormones.  I thought maybe that would fix everything.  Things got bad my junior year of college.  I had good grades, classes were easy for me, I had gotten this wonderful scholarship, gotten an internship for over the summer, I had friends that had become roommates and we would have fun together, but towards the end of the year, I started not wanting to do much with them, except for maybe drink.  I figured if I got drunk, I could just escape for a little while.  And it was fine for a short time.  \n\nWhen I went out of state to do an internship things got really bad.  I met a lot of nice people, and a friend from my major was with me, but I felt so alone.  I felt like I needed to harm myself, but wasn't exactly sure how.  While everyone else we were working with went out and had fun, I stayed in and cried, drank alone, started taking handfuls of whatever OTC medications I had on hand, which wasn't much or anything good, and washing them down with alcohol.  I didn't know what they would do, I figured I probably wouldn't die, but I wouldn't mind harming myself.  I remember lying in bed, facing the mirror on the closet door, with my heart racing, skin strangely splotchy, and pupils completely messed up.  \n\nThen I did something dumb.  I told my friend how I was feeling and what I had been doing.  He flushed whatever otc meds I had down the toilet and kept close watch of me.  At the time, I guess I felt grateful.  But as time went on, I wish I hadn't told him.  I didn't want him to stop me from doing anything dumb, but more importantly, now I felt like a burden.  I hated myself even more for stressing him out.  We don't really talk much anymore.  He's married and seems to have a good life.  \n\nI told my doctor about how I was feeling, and she put me on 10 mg of citalopram. It didn't really help.  When I got back to college after that summer, I should have been so happy.  It was my senior year, I was living with my girls I had known since freshman year, they were all so excited.  At first I tried to act \"normal,\" we would go out to bars or parties, spend lots of time together.  But that got tiring.  I just wanted to stay in my room, live off of alcohol in hopes that I could forget everything, and hurt myself.  I started burning myself with a curling iron, I'm not sure why.  My thighs were covered with blistered burns.  Initially they left faint scars, but eventually they disappeared.  \n\nThe don't really remember when that stopped being enough.  But I do remember that the first time I cut myself, I didn't know what to use, so in desperation, I wrapped a beer bottle in a towel and hit it with a hammer.  I tested the pieces to find a sharp enough one and kept the shard in my nightstand, but soon I graduated to an exacto knife.  I didn't want to bleed out, I didn't want anyone to know I was doing this, so I only shallowly cut my upper thighs.  Somehow just watching thin cuts bleed was calming and made me feel better.  I still have the scars over 4 years later, but no one knows.  \n\nMy doctor increased my dose of citalopram.  I guess it kind of helped.  Somehow I made it through my senior year, somehow I got A's even though I missed so many classes, telling everyone I was \"sick.\"  I guess it wasn't a lie, but I don't think anyone knew what was truly wrong.  There were I few times that year that I told myself I was nuts and threw out my exacto knife, but then I would just go buy another and repeat the cycle: cutting, convince myself I'm insane, throw it out, buy another a few weeks later.  The worst was when I got the codeine cough syrup from the clinic because I was \"coughing all night and couldn't sleep.\"  I got super drunk alone in my bedroom and drank the whole bottle.  I was very upset to wake up the next morning.\n\nI never applied to grad school like I initially planned.  I lied to everyone who asked why I wasn't going to grad school right away.  Time at home was strange.  I got a crappy job that I didn't particularly enjoy just to do something.  I was afraid to cut myself at home, afraid my parents would go in my room and find the blade.  But eventually the cutting cycle continued.  I'd take a razor blade, for the box cutters, from work, cut myself when I needed to, throw it out, then grab another a few weeks later.  Eventually I got fired for a ridiculous reason.  My parents were out of town that week.  I cut myself a lot, but always made sure to hide the razor blade.  \n\nI thought things would be better when I went to grad school.  My doctor finally ended up changing my hormone dose, and I think it helped a little, but I felt alone and friendless in a new city, because I was.  That first year of grad school was the last time I cut myself, though I still do feel like I want to sometimes.  \n\nMost of my time in grad school was relatively uneventful, but I did meet my boyfriend before my second year.  We've been together over a year and a half.  I love him so much, but even that isn't enough.  I finished most of my classes, but I don't think I'll ever graduate,  and I have lost all motivation to finish everything.  \n\nI got a shitty job after I finished my classes, one that doesn't pay a whole lot, but somehow I'm still doing it, I guess I'm a moron.   I feel like half of the people at work hate me and the other half just put up with me.  I certainly don't think any of them would miss me.  \n\nI don't even know if my boyfriend would miss me.  I think I just hold him back.  He doesn't know that something is wrong with me.  If he did, I don't think he would have gone out of town.  He's been gone for a few weeks.  He took most of his guns with him, but there is an assault rifle under the bed.  Part of me is upset that he took them, but then part of me wouldn't want to shoot myself and leave a terrible mess anyway.  \n\nI just want to plan it out right.  I bought a ton of poppy seeds online.  Right after my boyfriend left, I shook up some of them with some lemon juice and water to see if they could get me high.  After I drank the liquid, I felt very warm and eventually couldn't keep my eyes open, I was so at peace.  When I woke up I got very dizzy and vomited a few times, but it was good to find out that the seeds worked.  \n\nI still have about six pounds of seeds left.  I don't know how many I should use to make a strong \"tea.\"  I guess I could use them all, then get really drunk, down the \"tea\" and hopefully fall asleep and not wake up ever again.  \n\nI can't do it yet though.  Is it weird that I don't want to die on a day I'm supposed to go into work?  If I plan it right, I'll fall asleep forever on a day off, and hopefully they will find out in enough time to schedule someone to cover my shift.  Thankfully, my boyfriend should be coming home around the day after my days off.  I don't want him to walk in on me and call an ambulance or anything, I don't want to be in a mental hospital. I don't want there to be a lot of decay or anything by the time he gets home, I'm sure coming home will be a bad enough experience.  I also don't want him to have to drop everything and come home early if he doesn't hear from me.\n\nI have a little over a week left.  I don't think I'm going to leave a note.  While it would be nice if the assholes at work felt bad and guilty if they knew I killed myself, I don't want the people that I like to feel guilty.  Part of me does want to leave something reassuring to the people who aren't assholes, but then that will give away that it was planned, and I don't want kind people to blame themselves.  After all, it's not their fault, this is just me. \n\nI feel the need to clean the house before next week, so I'll have to work on that for the next few days.  I bought a huge bottle of rum that I can wash down with poppy seed tea.  I just hope that everything goes the way I intend.  If I wake up next Wednesday morning, I don't know what I'll do.   \n\n\n", "class": "suicide"}

You are all very king I appreciate your concern for me. \n\nI'm been thinking about suicide or at least hurting myself for a while now. I'm taking medication and it helps, but the thoughts always find a way of creeping into my head usually during times of high stress. I'm a recent college graduate and I have been experiencing high stress at my new job. I cannot seem to perform at an acceptable level and I'm really starting to resent my job and my employer.  The thought of being fired at my first job post-college is enough to make me go over the edge. I cannot stand the possibility of being a failure. In addition I'm disillusioned with life in general and I don't feel I will ever make any kind of significant impact in any aspect of my life. I'm really overweight and I have tendency to overeat which is only making me bigger.

I woke up chilly even tho the room was like 85 degrees and had a stomach ache my throat was scratchy and I generally felt ill. My dad yelled at me to wake up for school and I said to call in sick. Also I was feeling kind of depressed yesterday and it carried over do even if I wasnt sick I woulda taken today off as I'm a second semester senior and honestly done with school. Anyways my dad starts throwing a tantrum, slamming doors and saying why do you even bother going to school. And honestly hes right. My grades are pretty sub par and the only thing that stops me from failing are my test grades, and I kinda feel like that I wronged him somehow. I try to block out the noise with some music and headphones and eventually he leaves. Later I force myself to eat some ramen and go into my laptop to finish some history IDs and English essay. Probably the first time I considered doing them all year honestly as the counselor said I should try to complete them and get back into the swing of things.  And I find that he changed the wifi password. So I kinda do nothing for 15 minutes as I dont like calling him and then I find the courage to call him. And I say that can you unblock the CPU so I can do homework today? And he says to give him 30 minutes and hangs up. Then he calls back and says that why I'm doing hw today and he says that I should a done it on the weekend and that I'm a liar. And in the middle of explaining a day b days he hangs up and I'm infuriated. This fucking hypocrite just cuts me off mid sentence calls me a liar lazy trash. Like I get it already I'm human garbage but like I hate myself enough already. I've already told him I was depressed and and also sometimes suicidal but that's besides the point. The angrier I got the more depressed I got till I got a glass and poured myself some bleach, but not before trashing my room punching my mirror (and probably injuring my hand) and kicking a small hole in the wall. And I write an unfinished suicide note before stopping myself:\n\nI honestly wanted to work on homework but if that's what you think that's fine. Just know that every day I contemplate whether or not I should kill myself and everyday I think I'm the most worthless human being to ever exist on the planet. There's no one I hate more than myself. You always brush it off and insult me afterwards and I take it. I tell the truth you call me a liar. I call out and you dont listen. I'm sick of living. I'm sick of being alive. Everything I do is wrong. I cant't ever do anything right.\n\nAnd start feeling pit freezing pit of despair within my chest. I feel like a horrible person for wanting to die. I feel like the trashiest trash for not liking the middle class life. Like people would kill to be me and yet I'm here about to throw it away. Like I know people will say that suicide is selfish or that other people will be hurt or that I should be grateful but DO YOUBREALLY THINK I GAVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW?? LIKE HOLY SHIT SHUT UP AND LISTEN FOR 30 FUCKING SECONDS YOU SELF CENTERED SELF RIGHTOUS SELF PROCLAIMED SAVIOR OF HUMANITY. I DONT   WANNA HEAR IT. WHY CANT YOU PEOPLE LISTEN THERES A REASON WHY MY SISTER AND MY MOM LEFT YOU AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO LIVES WITH YOU WANTS TO DIE And I would live for my mom but while I was sleeping in over the summer while I was visiting her in LA she barged in and said \"you're lazy and no one in the family loves you\" Every time I remember it it gets worse but I'm pretty sure she said at least that because my sister remembers she said something like that. And now thinking about it I just wanted to commit suicide to prove horrible of a parent both of them were and that's a pretty lame way to go haha. \n~\nNow that I've written everything out I feel kinda better.

I'd be one less financial and emotional burden but at the same time i'm worried i'd cause some sort of domino effect in my family if i died. sometimes i wish i'd just get into a car crash or something so they wouldn't think \"where did we go wrong\" or ruminate if i died. usually i hate when strangers are like \"you are worthy/loved/beautiful\" etc because you don't know me, those are just general things to say to make a stranger feel better, but if there's anything happy/positive that you want to talk about in the comments feel free to share. i'm surrounded by so much negativity. this world feels so dark i just want to hear about happy things right now, it can be about you or something you heard in the news, or some interesting fact, anything :)", "class": "suicide"}

(/xpost from r/relationships)r/suicidewatch, I posted this on r/relationships but I wanted to try posting it here too.\n\nFor as long as we've known each other, and probably long before that, my best friend J has struggled with severe depression. It got much worse when her mom died of cancer in 2009. Her dad remarried and has zero involvement in her life. Her mom always took care of the emotional stuff, and he didn't know how to handle J's issues on his own so he just bailed. I guess I shouldn't judge him for it, but I do.\n\nJ has mentioned suicide for years. Not once or twice. Hundreds of times. Thousands even. Years ago, it was only when things got really bad. Lately, it seems like things are always really bad. Partially, life has thrown her some shitty circumstances, and partially, she keeps bringing problems on herself by intertwining herself with toxic people and blaming her misery on their inevitable shittiness. When anything goes wrong, her go-to has become suicide. She tells me she wants to die, she wants to kill herself, she would if she was brave enough. And every single time she says this to me, I fight a war with myself. I am so scared that any move I make could make things worse.\n\nI have no one I can turn to in her family. I have tried contacting her dad and telling him about this in the past, and he did nothing. I am the person who has the most responsibility for her (other than herself obviously), whether that's how it should be or not. So I feel like it's up to me to take action. She won't fight for herself so I have to fight for her, and I have to do it in a new way. What I have been doing for the last several years clearly isn't helping.\nThis has gone on long enough. I can't keep gambling that she won't actually do it. Even if she doesn't actually do it, I can't abide her having zero quality of life. I can't keep listening to my best friend in despair and trying the same things that don't work.\n\nThis is where I need your help, Reddit. I am terrified to make the wrong move and make things worse for her. I am desperate and scared enough that I have considered contacting her therapist or the police, but I worry so much that doing so would be a huge betrayal of trust and might not even help. Maybe she doesn't really want to die and that's just the only way she knows how to tell me how much she's hurting. In THAT case, potentially getting her committed (maybe losing her job, etc) could just add to the mountain of bullshit she is already struggling with.\n\nEvery piece of advice I try to offer falls on deaf ears. Every comforting thing I try to say sounds like bullshit. I'm heartbroken for her. I just want her to believe she could be happy so she will try. Right now, trying to convince her to work toward her happiness feels like trying to convince someone to take baby-steps toward learning to fly. To her, happiness feels like an impossible dream she will never really get to experience herself, so it feels fucking pointless to try to fight for it. She has even said, \"if I ever get happy, that's when god will kill me. I know it.\"\nPlease help Reddit.\n\ntl;dr: My best friend has talked about suicide for years, she has no close older relatives who I can turn to for help, and I am scared that any move I make will be wrong.", "class": "suicide"}

I am not gonna go around bullshitting on the country I live or the culture. But I've had enough with the way most of them treats women. Let's consider the case of a rape victim, If the victim is someone that doesn't dress or live up to their social norms, what happened to them was their mistake. The lady deserved to be sexually assualted for wearing revealing clothing or going out at night. She literally asked for it by intentionally enabling themselves to be in a situation like that. You're a living, breathing human and you're bound to enjoy sexuality as much as men does. But your gender makes you sl*t, sex before marriage is a sin, women aren't meant to have multiple sexual partners, this is what I've heard and been taught my entire life. \n\nYesterday, I shared an image of two couple from the new Netflix film The Old Guard on my Instagram story, and my ex boyfriend literally just called and yelled this to me \"Do you really know how everyone perceives a women who shares pictures of gay dudes on social media? Quit proving everyone you're a who*e.\" Seriously, the picture I shared was in no way sexually suggestive. It was simply a picture of two guys I found adorable and he went on to dig the entire plot and came off attacking me. I know this makes no sense, but that's how things go around where I live. I personally don't have problem with people with having multiple partners in the past aslong they're not being unfaithful and is in no risk of transmitting STDs. But once the word goes out that you're not a virgin and had two or more sexual partners, bravo you just made to the sl*t list! You're no longer bound to have a family, friends or to be respected. In general, their so called sl*ts doesn't deserves to have a decent life, despite doing nothing but enjoying their sexuality. Even the emotionally manipulated, blackmailed ones aren't considered 'victims' in front of the society. Revenge porn, leaking illicit contents are all well appreciated because a girl chose to end relationship with a guy.

{"id": "283", "text": "The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. \n\nSo, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. \n\nSo, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. \n\nNo, I am not the \"typical\" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. \n\nIt's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close.

We chose to sing under our spell from the mlp rainbow rocks movie (btw them girls watching them back have a weird tension about them), I was originally a backup singer but main girl couldn't handle the role so I took it and I sung my little heart out and we got to the finals but we lost to someone singing a Bruno mars song or something idk. I was sad we lost because I was 8 and I really just sung in front of hella people only to loose. ( didn't matter to me because the prize was a tennis racket and a ball from Poundland) oh well, now I've remembered this I have a massive flex on people because I went and did that.

I broke it up with her senior year because I wanted to hang out with my friends more and I felt like she was too clingy. We started talking again a little after high school. But we were in the friend's stage. She would go out with some guys just to make me jealous (she told me this later). And we got back together before she could get in a committed relationship. So fast forward seven years to the present we been married and we just talking about old times and talking about high school and she tells me that she indeed slept with a friend of mine while we were broken up. To me I'm shocked and now I just can't stop picturing it in my mind of the image of those two having sex. Since we dated so young I never had really never had sex with anyone else except her( very embarrassing to say but I want you to get where I'm coming from. So to me sex is something that is special) and now everyday I just picture what they could have done like all the positions and stuff and all the stuff before sex. She says it didn't mean anything and she was trying to make me jealous at the time but felt bad after so thats why she never told me. I know she didn't do anything wrong because we were broken up but now when I see her or at work thats all I can imagine. Am I insane and making too much of it? she hates talking about it so it's hard just to tell her how I feel but I just picture them so vividly. It been getting me depressed and been seeing a doctor about it but still that doesn't help. So i don't know what else to do. How do i stop picturing it?

{"id": "7747", "text": "The reasons that make people depressed and suicidal IMO1. While you are alone, you let negative thoughts take over your mind. You did this a few days in a row and it became a habbit.\n\n\n2. You don't do what you love in life. Try to do what you love and don't force yourself into doing things you hate. If you really hate ur job then quit. You hate anything? Get rid of it if you can. Or at least stay away from it.\n\n\n3. You think you need something but you really don't. You are frustrated because you think you deserve something, maybe you do but thats the luck of the draw. All you really need is food, water and shelter to survive.\n\n4.Because of society. It tells you what your life should be like. Its just a recommandation, don't take it too seriously. It makes you think you are worthless if you dont obey its rules. But its just not true.\n\n5. If none of the above...you may have a real, temporary problem. Something that can't be solved/avoided no matter what...Like a convict being imprisoned in jail. Like a kid not being loved by the parents. In this case, I'm sorry. I hope you can carry on. But even those problems will be solved in the end... time will solve them.  The prisoner will get out of jail eventually...the kid will grow and will be independent of his parents eventually. There is still enough reason to carry on.\n\n6. The permanent real problems. Like the prisoner sentenced for life. Or like someone with a disability. This saddens me the most.

{"id": "10222", "text": "It's either everything at once or nothing at all. (20F)This is going to be quite long, I\u2019m sorry. \nI don't know if this is all going to make sense, but I just need to let this out now while I can. I'll try to be as coherent as possible, but I apologise if nothing makes sense at all. \n\nAs the title suggests, I either feel everything at once or nothing at all. I don't know how to describe what I mean by \"everything\" but basically everything feels so intense and it's like experiencing every emotion all at once. And then suddenly everything shifts from colourful to nothing. I feel so numb and everything seems to be so static. This drop from one pole to another is so frustrating and tiring. \n\nI've always been sad growing up. I only know my dad through pictures as he passed away in a car accident when I was young. It was my fault though. I was with him in the car. If i wasn't the ill child I am, or if I simply wasn't born, he'd still be here in this world. I always think about how I never got the chance to tell my dad that I loved him and to go out with him. Everyday I think about my life if he was around. His death affected my family so intensely. \n\nMy relationship with my mum used to be quite good until she remarried. I was really happy that she was going to have a partner to be with and for the fact that I still somehow get to experience what it\u2019s like to have a father. Her husband was really nice to use and he treated us like his own. Until they had their own child, that is. I completely understand that naturally, he would love his child more than us because obviously, we aren\u2019t related to him. I was starting to feel like family isn\u2019t just about blood. But unfortunately, it is to her husband. All their attention were starting to shift to our step brother. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my step brother and I am still close to him right now. I\u2019d understand if you think I\u2019m just a selfish bitch here, but my own mother forgot about us. She treated us like servants. \nShe wasn\u2019t too hard on my brother, but she used to scream at me for being a \u201clazy, selfish retard\u201d when I was ill. I suffer from cystic fibrosis and some other stuff related to it so being ill was a given already. lol. I literally thought she was going to kill me at one point when she was so furious at me she started hitting my head against the wall. I still remember evert bit of that event and I still have dreams about my mum coming after me to kill me. \nDespite her anger towards me though, she\u2019d still pay for my medical bills so I\u2019m thankful for that. But what was worst is that my brother was showing serious symptoms of brain tumour but she didn\u2019t do anything about. We only found out about it when he had a stroke at my uncle\u2019s place. If it happened at my mum\u2019s, he probably didn\u2019t even get the chance to fight. Turns our his cancer had metastasised to his lung when we found out. He passed away eight months after his diagnosis. It really shattered me when he died. He was such a talented 18 year old who had so much to expect in the future. After his death, my uncle and his wife offered to take me in and ever since, I\u2019ve been living with them. \n\nLooking back at time, I feel like I was coping quite well with my emotions until my boyfriend died 3 years ago. I met him a few after my brother\u2019s death at hospital. He too had cancer and I really didn\u2019t want to lose anyone anymore but we started seeing each other even when we weren\u2019t in hospital. He was there for me whenever I needed him. He'd make sure if I've taken my medication and he always reminded my to eat and drink. I know this kind of sounds like TFIOS but my relationship with him was basically like that film. \nI was really afraid to enter a relationship as I have borderline personality disorder and I\u2019m bipolar as well. You can imagine how hard it is to be with a person like that. But he didn\u2019t leave when I told him about it and stayed with me despite the awful things I\u2019ve said to him. He was just beyond amazing. \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve had thoughts of suicide before my brother passed away, it\u2019s become more intense especially after my boyfriend passed away. I tried a few times and I got really close but it just left me in a coma for a few days. It just made everything worse especially after my second attempt, my psychiatrist only gives me medication for a week, my aunt checks on me every fucking hour just to check if I haven\u2019t cut myself and if I\u2019m still alive. Everything is so controlled around me. I feel so trapped in my mind and in my surroundings. I want to live, but I don\u2019t want to live. I want to feel better, but these thoughts are now my comfort zone. All of these dilemmas are too hard for me to weigh. I can neither choose to live or die as my life is meant to be shorter than everyone else. I can\u2019t deal with the physical torment and mental torment I go through everyday. My body is never at peace and so is my mind. I can\u2019t even get a lung transplant even if I wanted to since I have a few mental illnesses and because I\u2019ve attempted suicide a couple of times. A part of me wants another chance to live, but I\u2019m not \u201creliable\u201d enough. Sometimes, I feel like my mind is so peaceful and even feel like I want to live, but then it\u2019s just another bipolar cycle. I become depressed as hell right after and just makes me want to kill myself, but just too depressed to even do something about it. It's been really hard lately and my aunt makes a big deal out of everything like staring at a knife before dinner. \nTons of people have lectured me about how it\u2019s so wrong to commit suicide and that I should learn how to find worth in my life. But I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m just running towards death everyday and at twenty, I\u2019ve lived the average life expectancy of CF patients. Everyday that passes, a part of my body is deteriorating. Why should someone who\u2019s capable of ending their life from be expected to carry on in an extremely suffering capacity, slowing getting worse, hoping their life to be taken away, live? I\u2019ve seen others who battle CF pass away. It\u2019s pure torture. Why on earth is suicide a \u201ccrime\u201d in our \u201cmodern\u201d society?\n\nI know this is all just a long word vomit, but I don\u2019t care if no one reads it. Thank you so much though if you did. I just wanted to write it out and feel like someone\u2019s listening. ", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "32", "text": "Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.\n\nI am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she\u2019s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.\n\nShe made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I\u2019ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.\n\nWe have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don\u2019t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn\u2019t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  \n\nFor about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn\u2019t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn\u2019t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn\u2019t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn\u2019t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.\n\nI miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn\u2019t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn\u2019t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.\n\nIt was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn\u2019t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don\u2019t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn\u2019t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn\u2019t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a \u201cred string of fate.\u201d  I don\u2019t believe in fate, but I also don\u2019t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don\u2019t have anything at all to give in a friendship.\n\nAfter fighting with Maren, and being told that I can\u2019t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.\n\nI am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.\n\nGoodbye,\n\nSteven  ", "class": "suicide"}
{"id": "9156", "text": "Getting Worse, Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago, that I go to, so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter. She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw. I smiled and said yes. She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could. Nothing fancy of course. I told her about how I've been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there, but I didn't want to go alone.\n\nThis girl responded with, \"I'd love to go!\". I was in shock when I heard this, as I'm in my early 30s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at 16. I've always been socially awkward, and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment.\n\nI told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there, thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store. She gave a sad \"aww, why?\" and I told her I had no idea.\n\nShe asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free, so whatever time is convenient for her. She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her. I was actually feeling somewhat happy, just knowing I'd be able to go out with someone and do something fun. I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time, and proceeded to give her my number. My anxiety since then has been really high consistently. \n\nFast forward a few days and I hadn't received any call or text, so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again, I asked her if she still wanted to go paint. She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it, only to find it in her work attire. She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts.\n\nThat girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop, but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me. 2 days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her. Her response was, \"I've been really busy\". I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to. I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me.\n\nHer response was one of the kindest I've ever had from anyone, more so from a girl. She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me. I sent a few more texts about how miserable I've felt just being stuck in my head, and how I couldn't believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life. She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her. At this point I started to fall more in love I guess. At the end of the night we sat outside and talked, I almost started crying while talking to her, because the more she shared, the more I could relate; until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something. I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes, jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure. I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me, just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people.\n\nWe get up and meet at the diner, where it's now 4 of us, including another worker, and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl, turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they've never experienced the hardships I've had to go through and shared their own stories. I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared. I couldn't bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl, just to connect with her. I wanted to so much, but there I was, locked in my fucking head, fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone. It was about 3 in the morning when we finally got up, the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story. \n\nWe had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold, the girl was shivering and that one other guy (not in a relationship with her) opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm. I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked, but I couldn't get that out of my head, even as it continued for a minute. When I got back to the car, I put my head down, wanting to just disappear. My anger  and sadness was overwhelming, partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl, and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind, which brought more shit from my past flooding forward. When I got home, I sent her a message saying I shouldn't have agreed to that group sitting, that it was extremely painful for me.\n\nThe next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop, that guy with the motorcycle never showed up. I could barely look the girl in the face, and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt, but there was no response, until closer to the end of the day. My depression from opening up, was getting extremely bad. Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I've ever received. When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down, because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable. Her kindness had brought my depression down, and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to. I told her, \"you helped me, so I'm going to help you.\" I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place. She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that, and seeing the money. At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there, around other patrons and some of the other works. I didn't think she understood how much she just helped me, perhaps saved me, so I insisted, and she refused again. So partly in anger, I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn't. I was fully intending to do that, because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back, but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn't earned it and refused to accept it.  My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before.\n\nI finally gave in and took the money back. I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn't fair, how I felt useless when she refused my help. I felt even more miserable on my way home. I think I probably freaked her out after that incident. I sent more texts trying to talk to her, wanting to just be with someone, somewhere. \n\nNOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD!\n\nEither that night or the next, I left the house. She had stopped responding to my texts. Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going. I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise. I didn't want to be alone, I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head. I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her, more than anything. All I could muster was just statements of loneliness. What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up. I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her, with the message, \"Even though you didn't accept the money, please accept this sunrise as my thank you.\". I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home (from being awake all night). I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great!\n\nThere hadn't been any responses for the past day (something she never let drag on), and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy, as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint. Regardless, I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep, I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble.\n\nWhen I woke up several hours later today, there was still no response since the night before. I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop, and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there. I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there, she asked me if I'd gotten some rest, which implied that she had read everything I sent. Further more, she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her. All she mentioned was me getting some rest. I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise, (there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic.)\n\nDepression kicked in heavily and I ordered something, before sitting down and drawing, trying to tune out everything around me. The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well. Through out the day I could hear the 3 of them laughing, and picked out several comments making fun of me. I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn't have to see any more depressing things from me, and I'm sure there's not going to be any painting with someone else. I felt myself shrinking further, and further inwards. Smaller, smaller, smaller, nothing, just not wanting to be here anymore.\n\nI wrote in my sketchpad,\n\n\"You asked me if I got rest, that told me you read the messages. I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself. I removed you from my contacts so you don't have to read my stuff any more. I thought the sunrise photos were nice. If you care, please speak to me in person. Show me through your actions. I let you in.\"\n\n\"Invite me out, ask me to hang out, show me you care.\"\n\nI want to cry right now, but I feel a painful emptiness inside, no tears, just sadness.\n\nTired and sick", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "3944", "text": "my friend hanged himself Hello Reddit\n\nYesterday I received a message from someone claiming to be the brother (let's call him Daniel) of an old friend of mine (and call him Robert). He messaged me using Robert's discord account so I had no clue if it really was his brother. Daniel started asking me questions about me and the relationship I had with Robert. We were only friends and nothing more. We haven't talked in a year because last time we did, we had a pretty big fight since he couldn't accept the fact that I found myself a boyfriend. Robert was drunk and never talked to me ever again. Long story short, Daniel ended up telling me Robert hanged himself in his appartment last year, but was found two weeks ago. Now this is where things start to be weird, because if a body is hanging and left alone for a year at room temperature, he should be in an advanced decomposition state. Anyway, Daniel also told me about a letter Robert wrote for me and now I'm waiting for him to send it.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure I can believe Daniel. I knew Robert had a thing for me, but he never told me about having a brother, I think he is lying but isn't faking a suicide a bit over the top ? In the messages I received, there were many incoherent things. For example, Daniel asked me if I was Robert's ex-girlfriend, but only asked me later if I was a boy or a girl. If Robert was dead last year, wouldn't his neighbors start smelling the corpse ? Wouldn't his employer phone him ? Wouldn't his dog bark at his owner ? I tried calling him on his phone and it rang, which means it's not out of service. I'm asking myself so many questions and I'm not sure what to do, this is a very weird situation I never had to deal with before.\n\nTL;DR:A friend of mine was found dead and his brother, that I wasn't aware he had, wants to send me a letter, but I can't trust him.", "class": "suicide"}
{"id": "9298", "text": "There's a bridge near my new house...On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted. \n\nMy head was pounding with a headache, my nose snuffed up, my shoulders hurt, my chest was tight, my back was aching. \n\nI cried. I cried hard. \n\nI cried about the rash consuming my legs. I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships. \n\nI cried about how I assume people think of me. I cried about my job. And my living situation. \n\nI cried about being different. \n\nI pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk-in clinic. Something I've been putting off for months.\n\nI went downstairs and jumped in the shower. And I sobbed while washing my hair. And screamed and yelled at myself, and the world; not through anger or hate, but because of my inability to change, or more so the self-sabotage that I routinely commit. \n\nI dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror.\n\nI microwaved some chicken fingers, and drank a bottle of water. I watched a YouTube video about a board game. \n\nAnd then I cried some more. \n\nI called the local mental health crisis centre (where I've dragged myself to in the past) because they've called me twice in two weeks, and I haven't returned either of their calls. \n\nI scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now, knowing damn well I might not make it that far.

My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it. The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours. My lungs filling with blood. Cold. Scared. \n\nBut I turned at the last second. Left instead of right. And just walked; for hours. I walked until the road ended, and I was exhausted. \n\nThen I walked back on the busy main street. \nWatching the people going on with their days. \nOnly stopping the get a pack of cigarettes, which I had quit two months prior, and a coffee. \n\nAnd then I went home.\n\nThe thoughts are still there, but I have them in check again. \n\nTo die another day.", "class": "suicide"}

My relationship of 10 months with the love of my life is crumbling, his dad passed two weeks ago and was sick for two months beforehand, and his anxiety is taking over his life. I haven't seen him since the funeral 2 weeks ago and when we do call or text I walk on eggshells because I never know what I might say will set him off. I can't do anything to help him, even just existing makes it worse for him. I am useless. I can't express my suicidal feelings because nothing could compare to what he's going through. He says he isn't sure he can continue our relationship because I've become a trigger point for his anxiety, even just me calling him yesterday to ask if I could stop by to see him and his family on Easter was enough to set him off. I'm a toxic presence without even meaning to be, it's just who I am. \n\nBut I am not ready to lose him, I can't go through another breakup that I did not want. I can't be abandoned again. I can't explain to people again that he left. I can't be faced with people's sympathy and empty \"well fuck him, you deserve better!\"'s when I know that I don't. I can't dodge reminders of him again and try to suppress happy memories with him, because remembering the good times hurts so bad.\n\nAnd by \"again\" I mean I've done this before - I've been left before. Again by someone I truly loved and was so happy with, and it came out of nowhere, he blind-sighted me. I still don't know why he left to this day. But obviously it was something irreparably wrong with me. It look a full year for me to feel just OK. At the time, I thought it was the worst thing that could and would ever happen to me. But I was wrong, the worst thing would be to have to re-live it. Because at least with the first go-round, there was hope that something good would present itself to me after the heartbreak I'd endured.\n\nAnd it did, but now the cycle is happening again. And I have no hope that if he leaves me, I'll be OK. I won't be. Because now I know I am worthless, useless, a burden. I know now that it really is me, not them. Nobody will ever truly love me, maybe I could find love again, but I know it would end just the same way. I can't do this again. I won't. If I lose him, I will end it.\n\nHe was the only thing driving my life forward. We had plans, to get married, to buy a house, he was living with me. If that gets pulled out from under me I have nothing to look forward to but the whole thing happening over again with some other poor soul. \n\nI have friends, but two of my closest ones moved away this year for their master's degrees and will likely stay there. They are happy and have their whole lives ahead of them, I do nothing for them but bring them down. I like my job but I don't make enough money to have a very bright future, I only make enough to live. My debt is years if not decades away from being paid off. The only thing I would ever consider staying for is my family, it would devastate them and I love them dearly, but they too will be gone one day, and even now I can't keep burdening them, showing up at their house in tears and having them console me week after week. It would be fairer to them for me to leave.\n\nWhat a testament it is to my weakness and uselessness that I can't even deal with the thought of this breakup without feeling suicidal; I can't even wait to see if it actually happens.

The people I do feel this way about have barely anything to do with sex, and I'd be happy to live out the rest of my life with them without sex, as long as they're there.\n\nThe girl I'm in love with has a boyfriend of 3.5 years. I'm in high school right now so that is an eternity. I can barely describe why I care about her so much in this way, but she's just an extremely compassionate person. I never think about her sexually. I just want to be with her but I know that will never happen. Her boyfriend is also my friend, and I can't do anything but want them to be happy. But at the same time, it's eating me alive when they disappear for a couple minutes because I know they're making out and it's just so conflicting to want them to not be together and want them to be happy at the same time. And I also know that she just *doesn't* feel the same way about me. She saw me have a complete mental breakdown yesterday. While it felt great to have her there for me during all of that, I'm certain that she just sees me as a messed up friend. Hugging her was the best thing I've ever felt in my life because it just made me feel like someone cared and she's the only person I've felt comfortable enough with to hug.\n\nI could talk about other people I feel this way about, which is a very short list that also includes an internet friend (male) who's seen me at another really low point in my life and a certain fictional girl whose name I won't say right now. The people I've felt something sexual about is also short, but is also really bad for me - her boyfriend. It would take a long time to describe why, but I actually can feel a little bit of that part of me when I think about him. The point is, I can only feel this way about people I can't *ever* be with. My life already sucked as it is without this realization - I had a freaking mental breakdown from stress yesterday, because my parents yell at me and insult me non-stop, even though they know how badly I'm feeling. I don't need them constantly harassing me about college or being mad about my B+ in math right now when I have shit like this to worry about. I really just want to die now.

Gf stopped listening to me, which makes me keep these internal thoughts and they just feedback on itself.\n\nPills apparently did an effect on me but it doesn't feel like it now. I feel more helpless than ever.\n\nSeriously. suicide seems more and more like an option these days. The main reason why is that, at least, I would get some fucking control over my life for once.

I don't even know if we were really friends, but that's besides the point of me writing this. It's just kinda been bugging me this week... other's from my childhood have died, but he was the first one that I actually really knew. I don't know what happened, I think it might have been self inflicted but I'm not sure. It probably doesn't matter either. But there's a reason I'm writing this. A Facebook page was put up for him and I can't believe how many people are coming out of the figurative woodwork to say their goodbyes. Even me... I probably haven't talked to him in 20 years or more, but I had a story to share. It's very touching reading everyone's thoughts and it makes me a little sad that he's not here to read them. That he can't tell just how much he was loved.\n\nMy point is that if you are feeling like it's hopeless and that nobody would miss you if you were gone, they would. It might be your best friend or someone who you played with a few times as a kid and haven't thought about since. We still think about you and want you to know how much you have meant.

{"id": "5393", "text": "Never thought I'd be posting here...Let me begin this by saying I have recently been diagnosed with depression, my doctor and I have both agreed that it may be partially due to the fact it's hereditary within my family but also due to my personal circumstances. I also struggled with anxiety earlier on this year but after being prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) for a while I found that all my feelings of anxiety disappeared which was great. Now I'm on Fluoxetine (Prozac) to help with the way that I am feeling and so far I am finding it alright after 10 days in terms of side effects but I am still feeling quite down about my life and suicidal because I feel as if I don't have anything to live for or look forward to.\n\n\nMy mother also suffers with depression, along with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, PTSD, fibromyalgia and other mental and physical problems that require me to look after her on a daily basis. She has suffered with the majority of these issues her whole life and her condition hasn't really improved. It's putting a real strain on our relationship because she's never my shoulder to cry on, I'm always hers. I just have to bottle it up. I do have a dad (my mum and dad separated in 2010 but only officially got divorced less than a week ago) but I don't see him very often as every time we do speak we end up arguing because I don't want to do things his way. I've tried mediating things with him but no matter what is said eventually we just shout and scream so I'm not really sure if I want to see him anymore, or any of his side of my family because they've always seemed to look out for themselves first and exclude me and my sister. She sees this too.\n\n\nI am currently employed at my local hospital but signed off sick due to these problems I'm having. I was so happy to get this job (even though the apprentice wage is shockingly bad) but I have reached the point now where I have taken so much time off sick (I started this job back in May and have spent a total of 6 days at work since then) that I feel horribly guilty about taking any more off and it's making me feel more suicidal. I feel as if I've reached a total stalemate because I don't want to go on benefits and have to rely on them and if I stay in this job, I'm worried I'll get fired because I'm unreliable and my illness is preventing me from doing my job. I was on Carers Allowance whilst looking for this position and it made me feel like I was taking money out of other people's purses for my own gain. My mum has had to claim benefits for years and I have been to the assessments with her and the way they are treated is as if they are just another number on a screen. It scares me and it's not a life I want. I honestly would rather kill myself.\n\n\nI'm struggling at the moment because I feel like I have so much to juggle and no one to unload all of my stresses on because my sister doesn't really understand either as she's never felt suicidal. I already have appointments booked with a therapist next week but ones I have seen previously were incredibly condescending and they only seem to want to help if you're slitting your wrists. I did have a large group of friends until recently but now I don't see any of them - we stopped speaking just before my 18th birthday. Now I spend the majority of my days alone apart from when I have to try and help my mum feel better. \n\n\nI would really appreciate some help as I don't think I can take much more of this. I didn't ask for life so I don't know why on Earth I was given it. I'm not special, at all. Life just seriously sucks - there's never any guarantee that my life is going to end up the way that I used to dream it would so what's the point? I have no friends, a lacklustre family and only more bad shit coming my way. Who in their right mind would want to stay in this shit.\n\nTL;DR: 18 year old caring for mum who has several mental and physical health problems and is also suffering with depression and anxiety himself, seeking advice on how to cope with mental health without therapy alongside working full time and caring.

{"id": "393", "text": "I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.\n\nI was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.\n\nOnly music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.\n\nThis is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.\n\nNothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it.

He isn't crazy about it and doesn't really get it but he at least tries which is all I ask. He'll sometimes read the book to me to set the mood, or if he's really feeling kinky tell me \"You're a mean one\" in the heat of the moment. He's even begrudgingly come around to at least playing one of the three versions of the film every time we do the deed (although we tend to stay away from the live-action one because it's too much for me).\n\nThe thing is, I don't want to hear about the Grinch or listen to the Grinch or watch the Grinch. I want to be fucked by the Grinch. And for the record this is common among women. The Grinch's bulging sack of toys to me (and many others) is what a Mack truck is to Cardi B. The fact that he's good with dogs and experienced trauma at a young age makes me want that long, fuzzy dick even more.\n\nMy boyfriend asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told him straight up. I told him to put on the greenest, silkiest Grinch costume he could find, kidnap me from my bed on Christmas Eve, and then ravage me in front of the Christmas tree.\n\nHe flat out refused. Said it was too weird for him. I was literally begging this man to let this pussy save Christmas and he was like nah, I'm good. It ended up turning into a fight where he admitted he only gave into my initial Grinch kinks to placate me and was still uncomfortable about the fact that I had moaned \"Grinch\" during sex a few weeks ago, but only because his song was playing in the background.\n\nSo he's drawn a line. And if I don't drop the Grinch fetish (which as I said is incredibly common among women but sadly taboo) he's done for good. I don't want to lose him over this. But it's really hard for me to see past my sexual proclivities especially during Christmas season. Is there any way we can even compromise on this, or do I simply need a more adventurous man?", "class": "non-suicide"}

{"id": "13211", "text": "I think the camel's back is breakingMy life is pretty good - I have a supportive family, a sweet boyfriend, and good grades, but I can't get the thought of dying out of my head. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just make all these stupid little mistakes that I don't think past me would have been bothered by but now all I can do is think about them and how I could have done better. I would feel better about this if I actually learned from my mistakes, but I don't. Just today, I was  listening to someone I know tell my class about how her friend broke their patella. Another girl asked 'like human friend or the dog' which everyone laughed at because we are in a vet tech program, so it's almost always about dogs, not humans (in the moment it was funny, though it probably isn't very funny in hindsight). Then the girl said \"no, the human. It happened in a motorcycle accident. I would hope it wasn't the dog\" so i got a mental picture of a dog riding a motorcycle and couldn't help but laugh. Immediately afterward, some chick said \"that's not funny\" almost under her breath and I think she was directing it at me. I felt so awful, I wasn't even sure what to do except say nothing and look away. It's just little mistakes and breaks in social norm like that that make me feel like giving up. I tell myself every day that \"today will be the day I won't make any mistakes\", but it never make good on my word to myself. I know in retrospect my issue is I should just not set such high goals and I should be okay with making mistakes, but I can't seem to do that. I don't really know what to do anymore. I miss the days that I was carefree and ignorant to what an idiot I am.\n\nI was having suicidal thoughts about a year ago. I was on birth control and I believed that was what was giving me those thoughts so I stopped taking them. It seemed to work, but then the depression started slowly coming back. I had hoped it was the medicine - something I could blame all my problems on - but now I don't know. I think I'm just broken. \n\nQuite recently, I lost my favorite rat in surgery. Before his death, I had been getting better at controlling my depression, but now everything is spiraling out of control. He was my ESA, and the sad part is, I caused his death. He was going in for a routine neuter, but he had a respiratory infection I was treating with antibiotics. I was worried about him,  so we asked the vet if he would be alright for surgery, and he said yes. I should have went with my gut and waited, but I didn't and it caused my baby boy to die. I remember telling him it would be alright and I would see him that night, before kissing him on the nose before my boyfriend took him in that morning. \n\nThe vet told us over the phone that he suspected it was mucus that clogged his airway, presumably from the respiratory infection he had. It's just so hard knowing I could have saved him by going with my gut. As a vet tech to be, it is especially disheartening. I'm meant to save animals, and I didn't use any training I have been given to make the right choice. I just don't know if I really want to deal with this anymore. I don't think anything happens after we die, so I figure it isn't that big of a deal to die a little early. I won't matter in the grand scheme of things. If anything, everyone would be better off without me. My boyfriend wouldn't have to put up with my depression, my mother wouldn't have to deal with me wanting to bring new foster animals into the home, and the owners of animals that I treat in the future won't be subjected to the possibility of me killing their animal because of a mistake. My boyfriends parents would be especially thrilled since they aren't very fond of me and want my boyfriend to be with someone else who is more social.  Me being gone would make life easier on everyone. The worst part is I don't want to feel this way. Logically, I know I'm just letting my depression talk for me, and that people would be upset if I died (except my boyfriends parents. I'm almost certain they are out to get me haha) I want to be at peace with myself, but I'm afraid I don't know how. It was nice writing all this out.

I tried to get help as soon as possible after the rape because I knew some serious shit was brewing inside of me, but it took 2 months for a psychiatrist to even get back to me to confirm an appointment. I tried at least 20 doctors before one finally returned my call. He was the one who diagnosed me, then prescribed me the medicine, and I liked him. But then he didn't even show up for my follow-up appointment, when he said he would try to add-in an SSRI for my mood. Everything else is also falling apart. The few times I have reached out to friends, telling them I was plummeting, they have bailed last-minute or kept pushing it back. I was seeing a counselor at a local rape crisis center, but I just started a new job that doesn't seem very excited that I'll have to take ~1.5 hours per day off to travel to go talk to her.

But long story short, I left an abusive relationship, left town and left all my friends. I was about to start nursing school on one day when everything hit the fan and I packed my bags and left. Now I\u2019m back with my parents since October. For the third time. I\u2019ve been through several relationships that have went down hill and have caused me trauma. Now I\u2019m with a guy who is genuinely a good guy, I do love him but he has mental issues of his own and all my issues are weighing him down. I have physical health issues on top of depression, anxiety and ptsd. I can\u2019t hold a job, I keep trying and failing. If it\u2019s not my Health acting up, it\u2019s my anxiety or depression that\u2019s so bad I can\u2019t even bring my self to leave my bed. That\u2019s not what I want. I\u2019m thinking of trying for disability but I feel like I\u2019m just making excuses and don\u2019t deserve it. I just lost my job after 3 weeks of having it and 3 months of finding it. I told my boyfriend they fired me for being a liability (which has happened in the past) but the truth is I walked out after having a bad situation with my health and getting sick at work. I felt embarrassed and felt like they were gonna fire me anyways. I know I should of stuck it out. But I didn\u2019t. \nI was about to move in with him, things were about to get good. My parents don\u2019t even know I lost my job.\nThey think I was going to move out this weekend but my boyfriend told me he wants me to prove I can hold a job because he\u2019s in no position to take Care of me, he can not mentally handle it. He told me he\u2019s not happy and his anxiety is sky high because of all the pressure he\u2019s under. He told me he does love me and wants this to work but he feels like I\u2019m not trying. \nThe thing is I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m trying or not. Some days I feel like I am then others I can\u2019t make proper adult decisions because I\u2019d rather just lay in bed and pretend not to exist. \nI feel like such a burden to my family and my boyfriend. I feel like I\u2019m ruining something that could of potentially been good. I feel as if the world might be better off with out me. Monday is my birthday and I keep getting this intrusive thought over and over that maybe it\u2019s time for me to go. I can easily make it look like natural causes because of my health situation and die in my sleep. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m capable of living a normal life.

{"id": "118", "text": "I feel so hopelessHello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.\n\nOkay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I\u2019m gay. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if I didn\u2019t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.\n\nI haven\u2019t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don\u2019t really care because it doesn\u2019t take a fucking expert\u2019s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I\u2019ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I\u2019ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there\u2019s definitely something wrong.\n\nTo further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I\u2019ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I\u2019m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I\u2019m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.\n\nAt the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn\u2019t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I\u2019d probably wouldn\u2019t because I felt like if I did, I\u2019d just spread my suffering to my family. \n\nAbout my family : As I stated previously, they\u2019re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of \u201cselfness\u201d I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn\u2019t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn\u2019t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I\u2019m feeling like absolute shit and I\u2019ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I\u2019m lazy and that even I couldn\u2019t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it\u2019s never going to happen, I don\u2019t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can\u2019t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can\u2019t help but feeling so fucking bad.\n\nI am scared that I\u2019m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I\u2019ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5\nYears no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind.

{"id": "8871", "text": "Need helpAlright before i start i may just start with the begining. I never was an easy child. I lived with my mom and brother. She left my father one day on a heafbutt. I was 3. She never really cared for me because i'm technicly the same as him. Im headstrong, impatient, got anxiety disorders and heavily sarcastic. At around 6 i was seing him like 2 times a years at most. She always made me feel like i was unwanted. At middle school i was fairly a good students. Scoring from 75-90\u2105 without putting much effort. But it wasn't enough for her tought. On the other side my brother who have a ADHD had an excuse for everything. Got 45\u2105? Thats normal. You hit you're brother? He deserved it. Didn't clean your room? I'll do it.\nShe did that for as long as i can remember. At around 9 i starting doing small chores like cutting grass for the neigboor for small amount. I scored a pretty high amount aimce i did as much as i could to get out of the house. Until i was 12. She started charging me a rent. And of course my father still payed his monthly check to her. I suspected she was drinking and most likely doing drugs but i never catched her on the act. My father told me she had a problem with it when she was with him. Around that time she made me see a psychiatrist. Guess who was paying. Yep. Me. After a few sessions, she told me my mother may be the problem. Whenshe confronted her on it ahe changed of psychiatrist. It went on for years. And meds were changing as often as 4 time a years. I was frequently beaten up at school and at home. She (mo never really hit me but she kept on saying i wasn't worth the effort. One day i asked my dad to take me. As soon as she got it, she made a statements at court saying he beated her. Obviously faked to keep my father from paying her for keeping us. One day my mom settled out. She had 2 other daughters. Both she cared for again making me the black sheep. At 17 i went to college in another city. I was fairly scoring good but i didnt like my degree after a few class. I told her i'd finish my session and move back home to work for a years or two to takey time to change of proffesion. She called my a whimp. Told me i'd be the same as my father and that i'd die alone. Really needed again. Same time met a virl online moved out near her and left her 2 month after. She cheated. Multiple time. Rented somewhere near my ancient job. She took me back in but since my mother worked in the same place, she fired me 1years after. I knew afterward why : she told my boss that when i left the house i stole some furnitures from her, told her horrible thing and said i hated my jobs. All faked again. On top of that she called depression when i came up and 2 weeks before she got back i was fired. \n\nNow for the main course. Im 22. Before getting fired, a girl started working there. I was kinda interested in her but she was taken. The thing is she was smoking drugs and his bf didn't like it so she came at my place for him not to see her. She told me almost anything about them and eventualy left him. We started smoking and drinking more and more. One day we were particulary stoked and i made my move. I touched her privates for a few minutes and she seemed to like it. She told me to stop because it was too strange for her. She stormed out and I was destroyed. She texted me and we talked about it. She told me she didn't know why she told me to stop because she felt like doing it but couldn't resign since i was her best friend.\n2 days later she came back and same thing happened. Homever we did it. I was so in the act homever i realised that when im drunk i can't get a complete erection but it all went pretty well after a few minutes. Around an hours later she dressed herself and went out. She told me she was sorry amd that it was a mistake. We kept seing each other to this day homever we never did it again. She now has a new bf wich make me feel even stranger and everytime she wanted to come here with him I made a new excuses.  I don't want to see him. To my great dissaray she freakily opened and she even tell me about what they do together and by that i mean everything. \n\nThis week we were drinking with a common friend and i was drinking and i passed and made an ethyl comas. They freaked out because she tought i was dead until she took my heartbeat (she work in health care) they left me on the floor with a pillow because i was too heavy. Before the went out i reached for the drawers and tried to stab myslef with a knive and i fell down missingy chest again. They hide the knives higher so i couldnt reach them and went out. The following day they came to see if i was okay. I told them i didn't remember a thing but i lied. They told me the whole story. I didn't want them to be worried.  Since then i restarted to cutting myself and i badly want to die. I just don't know what to do. No family. No one for me. No real friends. Im just done with it i want it to be over.

Somehow the old lady who ran into me didn't know I was there and tried to force herself into the flow of traffic, but I was in the way. Fortunately, I was working at the time and was driving around a company van, so I don't have to worry about repairing my personal car. The impact was at pretty low speed, I was stopped and she was doing probably under 20km/h (~13mph?) so no one was seriously hurt.

Still, this was my first car accident (either driver or passenger). Scared the living shit out of me. The van I was driving is fine, it just needs a new bumper and a couple of new back doors. The check engine light didn't even come on. If I could properly latch the back doors I couldve kept driving it around and couldn't care less. Her SUV was a little more beat up though, as it looks like itll need a new bumper, rad, oil cooler, a/c condensor, etc. She actually took the plastic facia of my back bumper off and it was stuck in her grill when I got out to look. \n\nI'm glad that she didn't get hurt, she was probably 70ish years old.

{"id": "11170", "text": "Been going back and forth on this decision a long time. Today was the last straw and I'm definitely doing it. Is there a convenient way to end it all?Background: Was huge into biochem in high school. Have done research in malaria, cancer, and kidney disease at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, and at the Department of Medicine in my current University, respectively. I was really good at it, and went to Intel ISEF as well as Intel STS winning awards at both for my research. I was going to be premed with a biochem major at my current university, then after my first year decided to pursue a business major, as I thoroughly enjoyed the entrepreneurship, finance and accounting classes I was taking. I hated the economics classes I was taking, which would count towards an economics major (important later in the discussion). At my university, we have one of the top undergraduate business schools, but you have to apply to get in even after your application the university. This is a two-year undergraduate business program for the third and fourth years at the university.\n\nMy application was deferred first round, and then I was rejected today. I had to choose another major so I chose CS. I didn't score high enough in my econ classes to select a second major in economics. Now I won't have the opportunity to pursue finance, unless I apply to my university's fifth year masters in commerce program.\n\nI feel like a huge failure. I've disappointed my parents, stressed myself out to the point where I am sick and have tried everything but cannot relax, will be doing an internship in finance this summer that won't help with my degree, my GPA is in the dumps (3.134), and I've completely lost track of my life, putting on a significant amount of weight, and being unable to make friends. I feel like my life has gone downhill since I switched majors, and I don't have anyone who understands me academically who can advise me. I've been restless for the past two years of my life (currently just finished second year of uni) and it seems like there is no end in sight. I'm losing hair because of stress, I can't digest food, and I have nobody to talk to.\n\nI can't pursue the field I am interested in since the business major is not offered outside of the business school. When everyone around me is being so successful and being congratulated on major internships, on admissions to the business school, and making loads of money, here I am complaining to reddit. Clearly my life has become so extremely pathetic. I do not deserve to live. I do not deserve the opportunities my parents have given me by paying for my college tuition. I do not deserve friends or girlfriends. I do not deserve any sort of confidence (which is probably the reason I have none). The only thing that has kept me from committing suicide in the past couple of years has been what my parents will think of me. But now I already know they're disappointed in me, and nothing will change that. I don't deserve my amazing parents and family. I have never gone to a college party or been invited by anyone anywhere. I've never had a friend, never been wanted, and I've always been working or on Reddit. Now I have even less of a reason to want to go to a party or experience college life. I don't deserve the clothes I wear. I don't deserve the food I eat. I don't deserve the space I take up. I don't deserve the air I breathe. I don't deserve life.\n\nThat's my situation, and I think I'm either immature or mature enough to know that I'm a lost cause. Please advise on how to end my life so as to have the least impact on my family.\n\nThank you.", "class": "suicide"}

I don\u2019t think that people like me in other ways than as a friend. I probably don\u2019t have what it takes for being something more to people. I am accepting this but I struggle with the pain of rejection and the fear of being constantly looked as just somebody to talk to. I feel trapped and the only escape I see is to end all this. I can\u2019t really explain everything but I think I managed to paint the picture. Depression is something I have never faced and its taking everything out of me. I am crying constantly.

I got out of a long term relationship(5years) and attempted suicide twice, lost my friends because of things I said to my ex in anger and pain and moved out of state on a whim and partially because I lost my job. In said new state I had trouble finding a job. The feeling of emptiness and loneliness comes and goes but every time it comes back it comes back worse. The person I used to talk to about these feelings is no longer there assuaging my dark thoughts she more or less admitted she agreed with how I saw myself and thats what caused the relationship to crumble she couldnt take the black cloud that I was on her life. I finally got a job my depression has been weak but it hit me hard today and ive been going through suicidal ideation nonstop. I dont like feeling like this I just dont want to anymore. Im alone running this life into the ground now and i feel helpless but at least im 2500 miles from my family so it wont hurt them that bad if I do decide to act.", "class": "suicide"}

I have a 2 year old son who means everything to me, and has always helped me push through, but I'm reaching a breaking point.\nBackstory: I unexpectedly got pregnant by drug dealer at the time, to be candid I didn't even know his name. I had just graduated high school 3 months prior to finding out I was pregnant. Despite the obstacles, we managed to form a relationship and stay together. Two years into it, the more I got to know him the more I realized he isn't who I want in a life partner. We separated and I am back at home with my mom and dad, who constantly criticize me as a mom. I moved back in with my parents because I work part time and go to school full time. I can't afford a place of my own, and after I separated from my partner I no longer have a vehicle.  Even though I've separated from my former partner he is pushing a relationship. He wants to get married and I don't have the guts to tell him I don't love him. I told him we needed time apart, and that's why I moved out- but in his mind there is still hope. I'm partly to blame because I will use him as an excuse to get out from my parents house for a bit, as he is the only friend my parents will allow me to have. I'm constantly having to lie to everyone just to maintain some sort of peace and a tiny ounce of freedom. It is wrong on so many levels, but I don't know what else to do.\nI've always struggled with depression, I've been on medication longer than I can recall- but the medicine just doesn't help. The void and numb feeling I carry reaches the deepest parts of my soul. I feel like I have failed in all aspects. I'm not a good mom to be honest. It tears me apart that I don't have the energy or joy like most parents. My son now cries for my mother instead of me. He doesn't want me to hold him, he isn't ever excited to see me, just her. I just feel hopeless. My parents criticize me for not giving my child a \"stable home\", and not providing him with the \"same opportunities\" that I was afforded growing up. \nThere iss so much more to the story, but I'm feeling like I'm rambling. I'm just basically at a point where I feel completely helpless. I feel like everyone (my child included) would be better off if I simply didn't exist. I bought a gun 3 days ago, and I've been fantasizing about pulling the trigger. \n\nI'm finally ready.\n\nI don't know what made me make an account and post this, I think I just needed to put it out into the universe. I'm a loner who doesn't have any friends, just my coworkers and this isn't something you can just dump on a coworker. \nI appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.\n", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "10995", "text": "If the Mormons are right and they get to go build planets and stuff, at least I have Sim City.INCLUDES SUICIDE, MORMONS, DRUGS, TERRORISM, AND SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION TOPICS. This is my life story so you should probably leave now.\nDespite that all caps warning, I assure you: I am not a terrorist, no longer consider myself a mormon, done with experimenting and am straight, and am only mildly off-and-on considering suicide, and I am drunk.\n\n*Mods: feel free to move this wherever if more appropriate. /exmormon, /suicidewatch /foreveralone, whatev\n\nHello,\nJust as a quick intro, I just wrote this up for no reason and then decided it was internet/novel ready. It's pretty long... Please ignore spelling and grammar errors. I am drunk.\nI was originally going to put this on a mormon board and maybe it belongs there, but I'm plastered right now and suicide seems better, so pretend like you're a mormon to read this. Or if you just want a quick laugh, skip to the last line.\nAnyway, I was born and raised a Mormon. I know everything about them and have nothing against them. It's a great religion if it happens to be a good fit for you. However I hate their EXTREME recruiting and retention tactics and despite my best efforts, I can't leave and it has cause me great mental stress to the point of near insanity and suicide. I consider myself agnostic now, but Mormonism is where my family roots are and I can't afford to leave, physically or mentally.\n\nBefore you read this and decide I'm a bad person, I have improved greatly since my lowest point in my ethics, morals, and substance abuse, though I am still having life-threatening issues with depression and anxiety. All I want to do with my life is to help people and live in a good enough manner that no matter what happens after death, I'll finally have a chance at being content and actually experiencing the true \"joy\" that you hear about at church all the time. Money doesn't matter to me, things don't matter to me. I treat everybody with respect and love and I just don't understand why many people can't see the logic of the golden rule. To me, it's just common sense.\nThe acts of terror and war in our world lately hurt me on a level that it seems fewer and fewer people can fathom. I am empathetic to the individual who is killed in these attacks wondering why somebody would kill just to make an example. I am also empathetic to the martyrs, murderers, or terrorists who were perhaps mislead to believe that killing imperialist Americans (or any other country that suffers from this) is the way to heaven and shows their absolute comradery and brotherhood to the religious group that took them in and gave them purpose. Whether or not they second guess their decision, everyone else sees it as a call to arms to initiate more violence. No teachings, even radical Islam, tell people to kill those who they don't agree with. They may idealize martyrdom, but not murder. The theory that I believe most accurately describes terrorism and why this happens is that they consider the US and other large Western-Culture civilizations as oppressive \"Empires\" that are infringing on their god-given stake of the holy land. They want our troops out. And if that happened, they might feel appeased, but that opens the way for dictators and governments that the rest of the world believe should not exist. It's a circle of evil that cannot be stopped (except for maybe genocide, and that usually doesn't work out too well for anybody). It's the beliefs of our forefathers vs. the beliefs of their children.\nIn short, I just don't understand why one person would ever even consider hurting another person. I often get existential and ask myself what difference it makes when death and the unknown beyond is imminent anyway. The radical few for some reason need kill those of us that just want to be left alone. What's different about them that makes them feel justified in killing (even if they have a \"cause\"), while I feel bad just stepping on a bug.\nI hope that made sense. Did I mention I was drunk?\n\nNow that you know how I think, I'll tell you my story.\n\nI was born and raised in the most Mormon neighborhood you can imagine. My high-school was probably 90% Mormon and Mormon culture was all I ever knew. My mother and her entire family are as Mormon as you get and my father is also very Mormon (though a convert). My siblings all have their own problems, but remain mostly active anyway. Out of all of them, I'm the oddball; the problem child. My family loves me and I love them, but religion often gets in the way of this. I often feel like their love is conditional, while I try to love them unconditionally. (That reminds me: Get a dog. Might prevent suicide.)\n\nI was the epitome of good mormon boys until my early teens and puberty. Because of the church and my parent's policy of complete abstinence of sex and even talking about it (except the single, half-assed warning my father gave me once that masturbating was evil, not that I knew what that was.), I gained some very incorrect beliefs about sex and morals in general. The first time I accidentally masturbated, I knew I was going to hell and physically and mentally punished myself about it by sleeping on the ground for weeks and mentally destroying what little self esteem I was developing. I never told anybody anything and prayed to god for repentance and wished that I could take it back. A few months later, a similar topic came up while I was talking with one of my older brothers and he actually let me know what was going on. I relaxed a bit and actually got comfortable enough that did it on purpose occasionally while still doing everything right (pretty dang common for even Mormon boys I'm guessing), though there was \"that seed of darkness\" planted in my mind because of my misunderstanding and unnatural sexual experiences. My mom also got me on some overly-intense SSRIs because I was a little depressed and questioning my beliefs when I was probably around 14 or 15. The side effects destroyed me. I never developed a normal sex drive, which has now lead to some unnatural fetishes and extreme social anxiety. I have never had a girlfriend and I don't think it's possible for me to ever have a wife and family, even though I think I would really like to.\n\nFast forward a couple of years until I'm 18, graduating seminary, attending temple/mission prep courses, and eager to go on a mission to experience another culture. In the back of my mind though, I realize that I've never really had a \"Spiritual Experience\", and I have many doubts and questions. I won't go into too much detail about those, but they were (and still are) your basic ones about polygamy, African Americans/Woman and the priesthood, why these things change if god is unchanging, etc, etc. How do people just have absolute faith about these things? The winners of wars write the history books, so I always take what I learn with a grain of salt unless I experience it for myself. I read the scriptures and book of mormon critically, and find a lot of it incredible, but a lot of it is also insane.\nEveryone says that if you ask with enough faith for a spiritual experience, you will receive one... But the mind is a complex thing and if I ask with enough faith for a sandwich, my mind will make me think I got one. Perception is relative and makes up your own unique reality, and now I have a sandwich and you don't!\n\nI knew that I wouldn't be going on a mission for myself, but for my parents. Plus there were still those misunderstandings and \"things\" that the church would be completely horrified of. I decide to start college before putting in my mission papers, just to prolong the decision, and my parents seemed ok with it. But when the semester ended and the reminders got more and more frequent, I completely lost it, packed up everything I owned, and move into a crummy 2 bedroom apartment in a bad part of town with 2 questionable acquaintances from high school. I had a temporary job that barely paid for my car expenses, rent, bills, and tuition... as long as I didn't eat and dug into my entire life's savings. My parents were kind enough to not cut me off completely even though they were devistated. They let me stay on their insurance so I could keep my meds and hopefully not get into too much trouble. By that time, I had probably been on every SSRI, SNRI, SSNRI, atypical antidepressant and antipsychotic known to man, plus several Benzodiazapines in order to keep me sane enough to stay in school even though in hindsight, they were doing more harm than good. By the way, despite all this crap, I found out that I'm sort of a genius and did amazingly well in school. As of writing this, I have several associates degrees, a (very close to) bachelors degree, a great GPA, fantastic references, and a promising future with likely any grad school I want.\n\nAnyway, It was around that time when I moved out that I went completely insane, trying everything to figure out my identity. I tried being bi and gay (because of the meds and no libido, I had no interest in girls) with a lot of unmentionable things going on in that apartment (though I am proud to say that in the back of my mind, I couldn't shake 'the Straight' and so no ummm... penetration... ever happened... though everything else did. I'm doing pretty good at blocking out that year entirely from my mind). There was also rampant substance abuse. I mean everything. And a lot of it. I'm extremely lucky to be alive. There was a lot of random use of cigarettes, marijuana, Extacy, LSD, Meth, ketamine, perscription drugs, hard liquor, beer, and combinations of many of those (which often lead to the permiscuous behavior above). I never really liked alcohol or smoking, so I was the pill popper of our group, sometimes taking doses that would kill anybody with no tolerance and would cost several hundred dollars for one weekend. I slowly got more and more into debt, had to refinance my car, and eventually had a falling out with my roommates (one of which considered himself my 'boyfriend' even though the feeling was not mutual. I decided I wasn't gay right about when he decided he was). Throughout all of this, my parents never found out about any of it because I didn't talk to them that often. I was also never caught by the authorities amazingly, despite some drug deals going horribly wrong. I've been beat, had weapons pulled on me, and have lost thousands of dollars, but that was common where I was living and I couldn't stop. It would have probably been good for me to be caught, but I was able to stay in school and at least progress academically.\n\nThe only place for me to go when this was all over was back home to my amazing parents who took me back and never pressed too much about my time away. They just laid down the basic ground rules about no drugs and alcohol (they suspected some of that happened), the importance of staying in school (even though that has always been important to me), work and chores, etc. This was also about the time some of my high school friends were coming home from their missions, so I even started going to church when invited and paying tithing again.\n\nThat brings us to the present, several years later. I have seen the right doctors and am on the medication that is (mostly) right for me. I'm doing great in school. I have a great family and support system. My old life is practically gone and if you saw me, you wouldn't be able to tell I was ever anything but a good Mormon boy. I completely understand how lucky I am and how good I've got it, but every second I live is hell. Something is wrong in my brain. I understand the concepts of brain plasticity and who knows, I could probably recover. But it would take a drastic change. Drastic enough that I think it would be impossible.\nEvery time I join my parents for church and someone mentions an eternal family, I see my mom cringe. One of my older brothers had a baby recently and I know it kills my parents that I'm not going to be able to be part of the blessing. We have a stack of men's babtisms-for-the-dead-cards that need to be done that I can't do (and I think my mom isn't letting anyone else do them, just in case). Every once in a while somebody will sneakily say that it isn't too late for me to serve a mission or go on a date, but how can I preach something I don't believe, or mislead a girl into liking a scumbag.\n\nI try not to get mad... I'm not against the church and am fine talking about it without getting defensive, but I'm feeling worse every day. I'm having more and more catatonic depressive days where nothing gets done. My anxiety is out of control whenever I do have to do something. I have frequent breakdowns, especially around finals. My \"friends\" from high school that went on missions don't understand and I haven't seen them in months. I don't really have friends anymore. The only thing I have going for me is my schooling and decent intelligence. If I could get a handle on things, I could make a difference in the world and do some great things, but I dont... I've recently turned back to some of the drugs after a year or so of being clean (with no help). They're the only things that make me feel like I'm worth anything. I know it may be a paradox that it's because of drugs that I feel worthless in the first place, but I would rather have some great highs and terrible lows than a constant low.\n\nI have to get out of here. I need to leave these circumstances. I have at least a year of school left so I can't follow up on what would be my optimal choice and go far, far away to graduate school. But I believe I would fail at that anyway because of my mental health and drug issues. I just finished up the temp job thats been funding everything for the last 3 years, so now, I am completely reliant on my family for everything. The only way to leave is to leave for good and hope that what's after this life is better. I have all the drugs I need to make it pleasant, and I know enough about them to make sure it works. Enough beer, Vodka, xanax, and Klonopin is enough for Allosteric Modification of GABA-A Receptors to allow the Medulla to shut down, and maybe I'd get some E and Ice to make it fun. I wouldn't do it to make anybody sad or to show them how much they miss me. I am just sick of being miserable every day. And if your response to that is to just \"change your attitude!\", or \"force yourself to laugh!\", then just shut the fuck up. If \"it always gets better\", then why has it always gotten worse. I may look ok on the outside, but I'm broken beyond repair on the inside.\n\nI've been to enough counselors and therapists to know that an internet message board isn't going to help, so I probably won't be back to check this. It's a throw away account anyway with a password that I already forgot. I'll admit I'm pretty wimpy and probably won't do anything rash right away, hell I'll probably never really commit suicide, but I wouldn't be that disappointed if I accidentally OD'd on something. I just felt closer to it tonight than ever and wanted to write down why.\n\nI just like, need another beer (That Apple Red stuff... Delicious), a dog, and a basement apartment with a backyard. Then suicide wouldn't seem better than life. Did I mention I'm drunk? on beer?\n\nIf there is a god and an afterlife, I hope I'm judged based on intentions and values rather than circumstances and actions.\n\nAnd if the Mormons are right and they get to go build planets and stuff, at least I have Sim City.", "class": "suicide"}

I received a decent divorce settlement, but my will to live was vanquished. I have been unable to rebuild my life, and to get my shit together enough to support myself. In December, my alimony runs out. I drank away the majority of my house equity. My savings will only support me until March at the latest. I'm finished.\n\nI've tried to build a new life with the woman I am dating. We've been seeing each other for many months now.

All I want is what I once had: living together with someone I love, building a life together, leaning on each other. I'll never get that again. It's all I need to focus; it is the drive I need to succeed. I am just one of those kinds of people who need the stability in order to flourish. I lack that stability, and I am failing.\n\nThe only person I can talk to about this is my divorce lawyer--attorney-client privilege. I called the suicide hotline back in July, and had 5 deputies visit where I am living, and took me to a clinic, where I was discharged 2 hrs later. (Never, ever call the suicide hotline.)

The best I can do is think of all the cliff notes and put them down as I think of them. (WARNING: This is probably gonna be a loooooong read but I feel all the info is needed to paint a clear picture because life is complicated and can't be black and white)\n\n**Also I will have the full text she sent me at the very bottom\n\n- She has multiple mental issues depression being a big one\n\n- For the past year we have been FWB\n\n- She loves me but I don't feel the same (trust me we have talked into detail and she knows \"I'll never want to be with her\")\n\n- She treats our friendship like we are in a relationship (this is the big kicker to me just ending this friendship outright)\n\n- She has talked about cutting and has cut herself many times\n\n- She has talked about suicide but as far as taking pills hasn't ever fully committed as she says she cares to much about her pets having no one to take care of them.  (4 ferrets and 3 cats)\n\n- She lives in what could only be explained a shack with a drunk/meth head father, she is pretty much homeless but works for Amazon as a driver.\n\n- I truly have tried to be there for her and help her as best I can emotionally and truly am able to blame myself for not being able to deal with her anymore\n\n- I ended the (toxic?) friendship sadly the only way it could have ended. (Our friendship has almost ended several times already but neither of us went through with it in the end after I guess talking it out) how I ended it was being very distant only saying pretty much the same thing of, \"its you now leave me alone\" (PLEASE REFER TO NEXT POINT(s) ABOUT THIS) as I knew the only way this friendship was going to end was for her to hate me.\n\n- I have tried my best AS A FRIEND to be there for her as best I can. It feels like it was never good enough. She would always apologize for acting a certain way yelling, getting mad at me, insulting me. But if I did anything wrong I would essentially be verbally abused/insulted until I take blame essentially. Again it fell like she wanted to be there for her like the equivalent of a boyfriend.\n\n- EVERYWEEK for a bit over a year I dedicated one whole day to hangout with her and another day after work and I would stay with her till 10pm\n\n- I am not going to say I was perfect in this friendship but if I was not answering a text within 10 minutes of her sending or if I did not text back because there was nothing added to the conversation to actually keep it going I would ALWAYS get answers back that were along the lines of (actual texts by the way)\n-----It doesn't matter you don't give a shit anyway\n-----There are so many things you just haven't answered and I have given up trying to get answers from you.   Because I know to you the question means nothing which is why i didn't get an answer\n-----Im going to go die now\n-----Should i be Apologizing \n-----Goodnight i guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\n It's obvious enough that you don't wanna talk to me\n-----I feel like I should just leave you alone forever and you would be a lot happier. Is that what i should do? \n\n- She talks to me about her dreams a lot almost always featuring me\n\n- Our sex was ungodly amounts of good, like I am sure would make everyone jealous good and probably will never have sex that good ever again. BUT that was not even a single reason why I stayed friends with her. Though she now thinks otherwise and has in the past sayjng I used her as a cumdumpster\n\n- I have told her and truly ment that I understand to some capacity her mental issues. (I listened to a podcast on mental illness that finally made it click for me and it was insane! No amount of videos, articles that I read ever made sense to me bu this one finally did it)\n\n- If I missed a question that she asked me while I was at work and I somehow missed it or never answered instead of asking it again i was told to find it or I got this kind of text\n-----No but it's fine,  i just double checked you never answered my last question Monday which was a curiosity question\n\n- I almost always would head over her house if she had a bad day\n\n- On her birthday I stayed the night with her cuddling as we slept as i always declined sleeping in the same bed/staying the night (i wanted to make it clear that it was out of friendship)\n\n- my hugs always made her feel better\n\n- me being around always made her feel better\n\n- i didn't have to talk to make her feel better as long as I was there holding her\n\n- i was pretty much her rock \n\n- i was finally mentally broken down from being put down over and over again if I was not this perfect friend she wanted me to be it feels like\n\n- if she was having a rough day she would essentially want me to just say something rather then nothing. But I can't just do that i can't think of what to say half the time and if i try to say something ot felt like the wrong thing and if i don't it was the wrong thing (we have discussed this before)\n\n- *My brain is racked right now ill add more as I think of them*\n\n** The text**\n\nSince I know you blocked me I figured I should just say this anyway. Maybe one day you'll go into your blocked messages.  I have decided not going to live anymore I have decided on how I'm going to do it,  So hopefully by this time next week I will be dead.  I  Don't know how to live in this world without you anymore, i just can't do it.  If I'm successful like i think I will be, just know you mean everything to me.  I was holding on because of you.  All the support in the world couldn't help me once you left.  You'll be getting a gift from me and I'll be making sure you get your game back with some weed for the future.

It wasn\u2019t terrible, besides that there was a ton of bugs, and towards the end me and my mom started overhearing the table next to us (solid 5-6 feet away) because they were talking pretty loud. There\u2019s this little kid, maybe 5-6, that was complaining that his baseball team was bad, he was in a jersey so he must have just played a game with his little league, and he was upset because his team wasn\u2019t contributing. The dad (dad I think?) had to explain to him that it was okay, etc etc etc. I was cracking jokes at our table about how \u201cI was so used to this conversation because I\u2019m the best at everything\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve heard it all before\u201d. Anyways I wish I hadn\u2019t. At the end right before we left, my mom hears the dad (I think the dad. She told me what she heard but I don\u2019t remember who she said said it) say \u201cI hope the kid who tested positive wasn\u2019t the really good player\u201d. Come the fuck again? First off, stop being a whiny ass bitch that your team is bad when one of your teammates caught the fucking virus. Be happy you\u2019re not on a ventilator. Second, to the adults at the table, why the fuck, **why the fuck**, are you eating out in public, around people, when you fucking know someone who tested positive. Why the fuck are you not quarantining, why are you out where you\u2019re touching plates and within feet of waiters and waitresses when you know damn well you might be carriers. I don\u2019t know if this mystery kid was at a game when he was positive. He may have caught it early. The kid may not have it. They may not have it. They probably didn\u2019t give it to us, we were distanced. But take fucking precaution. Just because you may not care about getting it, you clearly don\u2019t if you\u2019re more upset your bitch ass baseball team sucking than having a life threatening virus, doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t. Stay home if you were potentially in contact or proximity. I wish death upon no one but these are the kind of people that I wouldn\u2019t be upset if they caught the virus.

I was confused, at first I thought they were coming home from work but I realized it was going the same direction, then it parked by my neighbors house, after presumably driving around the block for hours, I told my brother and he pointed out that the truck was the cable/internet company so they are probably just fixing their stuff, but this van had been driving around the neighborhood for hours. My brother kept a close eye on them and he said the two people in the van were screaming and flipping each other off, unprofessional for someone on the job, at one point they split up, one took a latter (cable not satellite, no need for a latter) to house A, and the other goes to house B (across the street) without a latter, he said the guy at house A was messing with its electrical box, then climbed the latter but he couldn\u2019t see what he was doing based on his view, then he got down and went across the street to house B with the latter, he said they didn\u2019t have any technical equipment with them either. He and I think that two of our neighbor\u2019s houses were robbed, I told my mother but she didn\u2019t believe me. I just don\u2019t understand what cable company and would do two houses at once with a latter and have their employees flip each other off.

Nothing seems good any more even when I'm on medication.I could write a whole story about my two dimensional shitty life but I think I'd prefer to just sum it up in the least amount of words possible.\n\nThere is no career that seems interesting to me, dead end jobs seem even worse and my family don't seem to understand. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet it because I haven't thought of a cool way to do it. I'm being serious, if my life is so bleak and uninteresting I might as well make my death quite fucking spectacular. I also don't want to ruin anybody else's life in the process. For example, I jump off a building and hit a concrete floor, I wouldn't want some poor bastard to find my mangled body. I shoot myself in the head, what about the person who finds that mess? No. Not like that.\n\nI'm at rock bottom, the lowest I have ever been in all my life. I almost wish I was religious, maybe I could turn to a god for help at this time. I also wanted to add that I haven't killed myself because of my dad. I am his only son. My mother had a child to a different man so she would still have another son. I'm not saying that my dad would feel worse, both parents would be completely destroyed if I killed myself but you guys know what I mean?

{"id": "7962", "text": "Imposter SyndromeThings have been going pretty well for me lately but I don't think they're going to last. \n\n\nThey never do. My life has been a series of ups and downs and I am on medication for major depression and what she called \"mild\" anxiety. Which I can see because I have anxiety due to having been in real shit and not wanting to return to that. \n \n\nThe meds do help. They really do but I don't feel like I deserve anything good. In fact they make me feel like I'm looking at this all clearly and factually.\n\n\nI am constantly scared of messing up, my family doesn't actually care about me (this isn't an exaggeration. Any conversation steers towards them asking me for money.) I made my own family with wonderful friends and my lovely boyfriend but I can't help but think how much better they would be without me. \n\n\nI have found my father dead and dealt with setting all that up and dealing with my family afterwards at 21 years old. During this time I watched my dear friend of 10 yearsdie from cancer. She passed when we were 23. Last year my grandmother has passed (25) and now my family is calling me up for money again because they no longer have her to take care of them. A few weeks ago a childhood friend of mine  had passed. I'm assuming suicide as he wasn't doing well the last time we spoke.\n\n\nI'm 26. I'm going to school and working full time. I'm failing my precalculus class. I'll probably get at bachelor's at 33. \n\n\nI am in charge of my team at work and they seem to like me but I know I'm replaceable. I work hard but I don't think I work hard enough at work or school. I hardly sleep. I also have a sport I play but I'm not as good as the others. The girls that praise me only think I'm good because they're new. They'll be better than me in time. (As they should be! They're hard workers!)\n\n\n Unfortunately if I kill myself my boyfriend doesn't get my life insurance policy which is 150k. I keep thinking how he can go to grad school and get a nice house with that money so if I just die \"accidentally\" it would be okay. He'll have a great life.\n\n\nI don't think I'm worth all the love and support I receive from others. I feel like I'm a failure. I'm terrified of letting them down. I feel awful for wanting to die and I know it'll hurt them beyond belief but I've been there many times and I've moved on from their deaths. They'll move on from mine. I mean shit even my friends fiance has found a new girl. My boyfriend will find someone as well. I'm just fooling them and not letting them find someone better. \n\n\nThey'll all be okay without me eventually. I love them all so much but I can't seem to love myself that same way. I feel like I'm just in their way and taking up their energy. \n\n\nI haven't made a plan to die but I certainly don't want to be alive anymore. I guess I'm here to express my feelings without emotionally burdening my friends further. They all know I'm depressed and want to die. In fact my best friends are all mental as well so I don't want to trigger them.\n\n\nThanks for reading.", "class": "suicide"}

My bucket of hope is down to its last few drops. \n\nThere is too much going on in my life and I can't take it on alone anymore. That is the problem. I've always been practically on my own. Left to my own self. In my entire 26 years of living I've never met anyone that I could really connect with. And If I did make any friends that I could connect with, the friendship would somehow water down over time. \n\nI'm not sure where I'm going with this post. I'm so confused and plagued by all kinds of thoughts and worry that I can't write a coherent post anymore. Almost everything I try to undertake ends in either mediocrity or failure. I work so damn hard to make something of my life but every time life turns around the corner to kick me in the balls and crush my face into the ground. \n\nI'm not a real man. In my 26 years of living no woman has ever been interested in me. I can't see why since I'm not ugly or have a bad personality that I know of. Yet apparently nobody wants me. There is just something about me that turns women off. That's the conclusion I'm coming to. Never kissed a woman, been loved by one, never hugged or had deep conversations about life. Never made love. And yes I've date people and such, I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. I don't live under a rock or anything. Not that it would matter. I see all kinds of people ending up in relationships. Only I don't. \n\nI only have a few friends. One hand is more than enough to count them on. I know quite a lot of people and have a decent social life, but I just always feel like there is a glass wall between me and everyone else. Every time I put myself in a vulnerable position, I get hurt.  \n\nI'm truly tired of life. I truly am. I don't know where to turn to anymore. I don't know what to hope for anymore. Hope for me, has always turned out to be a thing that only enhances my inevitable pain.

They seem to have everything worked out, but didn't have to do very much for it.  People like that have just been dealt good cards and don't know about the true world that surrounds them. Reality is a very cold and heartless place to be in for some people. I've stopped talking about my problems to a certain person from my family I trust a lot. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems anymore. \n\nI just want to be loved by someone for who I am. That, I've learned, is not a possibility.

I don't have the grades, research or motivation to get a PhD. \n\nHowever, I feel like I've sacrificed everything to get this degree and I've lost it all.\n\nI wanted to drop out of HS and join the military, buy a house and use the GI bill to get a technical degree.\n\nRight now I am a full-time student, I serve in the reserves and volunteer at a clinic. However, it seems like anytime I do something good I can't experience it without thinking about all the shitty things I've done in the past and how shitty I think I am right now.\n\nI hate myself because when I was HS I got good grades but I hung out with the wrong crowd and we did things like egging random people's houses and stuff. I feel badly about that now.\n\nAlso right now my parents are paying for the part of tuition that is not covered by grants and my rent. This is pretty common for the town I grew up in, but it makes me feel extremely guilty and unaccomplished.\n\nYet, I don't really appreciate it, at all.

His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.\n\nWe both attend a university in a \"college town\" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon.

A backstory is a bit of a bitch, so I'll keep it short:\n\nI've been depressed for 4 years now. Fucked up a lot in elementary school, middle school was social hell (no friends AT ALL; my entire school hated me for whatever reasons they had), and now I'm a sophomore in high school, ready to end it.\n\nI've been getting in a lot of arguments with my mom lately. I'm trying to get my grades up, because I've been just too emotionally exhausted and weighed down by what feels like some boundless darkness tht I didn't do a LOT of my schoolwork. I've slept through entire days, gone to school drunk/high, lied my ass off for everything, ruined my parents' lives, and most recently, become a sexually promiscuous demon.\n\nI've stressed my mom and dad out so much over the past year, since they only found out I was depressed in September 2012 and I've had about 4 attempts since then. I've completely scared the shit out of my brother. A 12 year old kid with a brother who's constantly bringing home one problem after another. Drugs, drinking, sex, apathy, rebellion, and too much for a family to bear.\n\nI've lived my fair share an havent done anything to justify it. I've ruined far too many friendships I had, run down the most amazing teachers this world has to offer, and most importantly, killed my parents' sanity. It would really be best if I just leave.\n\nMy mom is threatening to send me to military school and I'm the most wiry boy you'll ever meet, and 6'3\".

So I would like to tell a bit about me.\n\nI'm a guy who has 23 years old, And I'm Agnostic. And I live in a strictly Middle Eastern Islamic country.\n\nI used to believe in religion but now I don't because all the violence which I figured out in it\n\nI'm hiding my disbelieve in the religion for my own safety. My life will be threatened if my agnosticism revealed. I could be 'infidel' in the eyes of the religious people.\n\nI was always dreaming of living in a place which I can confess that I'm Agnostic and living in peace without getting my life threatened.\n\nI wanted to have a partner and children who I can bring them up on my beliefs\n\nI don't like to date the girls of this country because the majority of them are Muslims\n\nAnyway it's prohibited and unallowed for the girls of this country to meet or talk with a guy\n\nSo here's what happened. I met a girl who is a foreigner she is a Muslim but she is very modern and has the characteristics of the girl which I have always dreamt of them.\n\nWe started to talk she was interested in me as a lover and so I am in the beginning\n\nAs days go by. I attached to her so much!. I liked her personality!. And I wanted to marry her!.\n\nAfter we met several times and talk to each other she started to not be interested in me as a lover anymore but only a friend. But my interest in her as a lover was remaining. I didn't know that she started to see me only as a friend.\n\nOur meetings remained. And one day I found out that she has a fiance. I was totally in shock. How could she has a one while she is with me?. I confronted her of that and she said that's nothing of your business you are only my friend.\n\nAt this moment I figured out that she was seeing me only as a friend which puts in a severe depression and makes me look down to myself because she chose him instead of me. The world got so dark and abandoned in my eyes. And I felt that everything is tight on me. Because the girl of my dreams falls in the arms of another man.\n\nI started to have thoughts of committing suicide and telling to myself this is enough of living this life.

I think about how and where I can light the grills and not get caught. Where I can park and not be found. I think about how to let someone know to be careful when they open the door. I think about how this will effect the people close to me and loosely connected. I think about how little I have prepared and how I have not left money for a funeral. I google cost of a funeral and realize its 10k which is so much money. I think of the burden I will be leaving on so many, but I realize that I won\u2019t be around to have to deal with the reprocutions of it. This reaffirms that I am a selfish, no-good person who does not really love people, just uses them.

I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).\n\nThis may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. \n\nI think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am.

{"id": "8613", "text": "Misophonia Causing Depression and Suicidal ThoughtsI just posted this in the misophonia subreddit then realised that they have a rule against talk of suicide (which I honestly think is kinda dumb) and promptly deleted it. Before I paste that post, I guess I'll quickly tell you what misophonia is. Misophonia is a sort of mental disorder that causes extreme anger when hearing specific sounds (very extreme and very specific sounds). It's different for everyone, but I am able to somewhat control it. Controlling the anger can be incredibly mentally exhausting, though, and usually ends it physical reactions such as my body shaking, jumping and/or pinching/hurting myself (not cutting) to ease the pain. \n\nNow for the post:\n\nA little bit of background information: I recently turned 16 and am living with my parents and my sister. I started developing misophonia at the age of 13-14 and my family has known about it for approximately half a year. I have a terrible relationship with my father mostly due to his narcissistic tendencies and anger management issues.\n\nIt's taking a long time for my family to adjust to my misophonia, but I understand that my mother and sister are trying. And I'm really thankful for that. On the other hand, my father does not care at all. Even just a couple of hours ago he was chewing a banana obnoxiously loudly in front of me as soon as he got home. Every time I tell him to stop or quieten down he freaks out at me. He tells me there's something wrong with me (as if I didn't already know that). I really try to stay calm and I'm honestly proud of myself for doing so. But staying calm in these situations has honestly taken a toll on my mental health.\n\nTo put it simply: I want to die. I can't escape him. I can't move out until I'm 18, and even then, I wouldn't be able to afford it. Every friend I've told has told me to just ignore him when he tells me I'm a failure in life and that I should die. They tell me that he's wrong and that I'm smart and will be successful. I'm sick of hearing this because it doesn't help at all. It just reminds me of how I believe every single thing my father says about me.\n\nGod, I'm crying now from writing this. I don't want kind comments telling me that it's going to be okay. I don't want people telling me how to teach my father about my misophonia. He knows what it is and uses it against me. I just want options. I need options on how to get out of this house. I want to finish high school and study in university. But if I stay in this house any longer...I might not make it that far.

I\u2019ve become incredibly self conscious over the years and wore large baggy clothing 24/7. I mean I love a good pear of  hoodies and sweats, but then that\u2019s all my closet was.

I kept doing workouts, running, biking, and just ate a lot less.  I told my close friend the way I felt and how I wanted to change it.

{"id": "7997", "text": "\"You look so innocent it looks fun to destroy you\"I was told that phrase when I was explaining one time to someone who I looked up to as my mentor when I asked, \"It shouldn't be such a frequent phenomena to occur everywhere I go.\"\n\nHaving Asian family and being the middle child, I was ignored and abused. I was bullied in school for not being a \"gangsta\"-clique in a school in the middle of nowhere/valley at the time. My 1st relationship ended up abusive verbally, physically, and I used to be a sex before marriage mentality until he deflowered me against my will. I finally was able to leave him when he cheated on me. (thank GOD).\n\nMy next relationship after that had pride, ego, and anger issues. I didn't want to look for a relationship but things happen -- and the worse happened with him. We never made it official but he kept me down when I was coming up as a freelancer. I left him too.\n\nIn the industry I'm in, every company or entity I've worked with was full-force sexism. Because I never had a career before and only one job I was taken advantage of and severely underpaid. Because this is a form of the music industry I've even had people offer me \"have sex with me and I'll give you access to all my connections\" to \"I'm taking your gigs and doing them for free\" to push me out. It's a full on boys world.\n\nNow I'm stuck day after day with different companies being a freelancer in the city. A female freelancer. I tried having a part time for a few months and even ended up with a manager who is male dominant  suppressed LGBTQ who is too focused on his pride than his business to treat any of his workers well with a turn over rate of people leaving within a month or so.\n\nI can't go back home, my family recently committed fraud and charged 500 into my name without me knowing. I have nowhere to turn to and my boyfriend cannot help me. I can't go back to school either I don't know where to go neither have the funds nor direction to do so. I'm constantly telling myself I need to kill myself because I can't escape being who I am and taken advantage of constantly.\n\nWhat else am I supposed to do? I know my thoughts were everywhere. I know no one can really help me. I've been suicidal for years with very good reasons to be like this. I have so many more horror stories and every time i keep pushing through my career with 4 years of experience I keep getting cucked out of my main income for being female... my experience doesn't matter at all. I might have to become homeless soon, especially living in a high rent city. I have no where to go once all my independence slips away from my hands.\n\nedit//: My depression keeps getting worse with each situation that eats at me with the same reoccurring theme that it's getting in the way of me trying to advance/work on myself*\n\nMy passion and self-worth is non-existent simply for being a female. I have no respect and cannot defend myself. When I do it worsens every situation. I am pushed into a corner. I am pushed into the ground. It feels like the only safe place is drowning in the waters of my depression. But it hurts all the same. if the pain is all the same why can't I kill myself?...\n", "class": "suicide"}

I've been living in countries with free health care, free education, fine learning establishments, have lovely and supportive parents and a great brother.\nI got caught up in the student partying, and the not-so-partying internet world. I failed my studies, tried another major, tried another university in another country, did my military service in the mean time (came out sergeant with honours).\n...but every time I found something to occupy my brain with, I'd eventually revert to my quasi-antisocial lonesome self, browsing the internet aimlessly.\nNot that I didn't accomplish futile things on the internet. I managed to crawl my way up from mere poster to head admin of (what used to be) a prominent internet forum, with tens of thousands of users.\nStill...pfft, internet...all the lulz and fails and wins can't give a man's life meaning.\n\nIf I sound somewhat cavalier about the whole thing is that, strangely, although I am not a happy person, I'm not really that depressed either. I know some really depressed people, and it's a sad sight. I wish them nothing but the best recovery.\nI just noticed that I'd stopped even trying. I've given up on all my friends, they gradually faded away (moving to other countries doesn't help, and facebook is a joke for \"staying in touch\"), was eventually too lazy to make new ones, didn't pursue any jobs, let my university ID expire, I did nothing but ...be.\n\nAnd in my book, just \"being\" is not life. it's not even existence, as far as many philosophers are concerned.\nWhat kept me alive for the most part was fear of death (duh), but more importantly the love I have for and from my parents and my brother, who is for all intents and purposes my best friend. It's just wrong and selfish to kill yourself. I knew that, yet I decided to not care anymore, and proceed with the grim deed.\n\n\n\n\n...ramble ramble ramble\n\n [The following is a bit graphic, it's my experience of trying to kill mysef, be warned. it's no /r/spacedicks, but it's still about death and how I tried doing it to myself.]\n\n\nAaaaaanyways, skipping ahead, I knew my brother was coming to visit me tomorrow, so the timing was right for me to not leave too smelly a corpse for him to find. I planned this for weeks.\nI cleaned my flat from bottom up, made all kinds of paperwork for my eventual demise, deleted the questionable parts from my porn folder, and sharpened my big knife.\n\nI opened up all my windows, to let the stench of my rotting carcass out, listened one last time to Albinoni's addagio  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbvcp480Y4 ), and went to my bathroom where my blood splatter wouldn't cause too much damage.\n...I tried stabbing myself through the heart...but just couldn't do it...my delusions of manliness crashed down...and I'd played this scene over in my head so many times...\nWell, no matter, I thought about my alternate solutions.\nHanging...yes...that seems painless enough.\nPoetic justice, I'd hang myself with an ethernet cord. I looked up on youtube how to make a proper hangman's noose, and proceeded to hang myself from my bedroom doorframe (it has a bar for pull-ups and such).\n\nI made a nice knot, tightened the noose a bit, exhaled so I'd die quicker, kicked the stool from underneath me.\n\n...\n\nI wake up, I see shapes, horrible noises, makes no sense, I faintly feel my whole body convulsing. My reptilian brain is sending signals to my body to wake up, to not die.\n\nwhoah, this is a weird dream, where am I?\nFUCK! I FAILED! FUCK! An ethernet cable is not as sturdy as it looks.\n\nFUCK IT!\n\nI dind't remember any pain, I felt like I blacked out within seconds. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I just blacked out, and had completely jumbled sounds and shapes in my mind for a few seconds when I woke up.\nIt's not the lack of oxygen to my lungs that's supposed to kill me, it's cutting off blood circulation to the brain.\n\nStill not entirely recovered, my throat a bit sore (no, really, just a bit), I take a nice, thick microphone cable, and try again.\nFUCK IT! I'm going to be dead soon, I'll just cut it to length so I can do the knot properly, it's not like I'm going to need it later on.\n\n...\n\nAGAIN! FUCK!\n\nThe cable snapped, again. I'm bloody 80kg/160lbs/several pebbles...this should not be happening.\nAlso, I felt a bulge in my rectum, like I was about to soil myself...I guess that myth is confirmed, then.\n\nWell...two and a half tries...damn this thing...I give up...\nYes, I gave up on killing myself today, because I'm incompetent.\n\nBut hey, you know what? I'm alive. I figured that since I, like anyone else, is slightly unsure about actually killing your/him/her-self...life won. In my slight oxygen-deprived state, I even figured, hey, maybe there's some kind of higher power that stopped me, made me fail.\n\nHo boy, what a way to be...born again, from who-gives-a-shit-atheist, to spiritual man...but that didn't last.\n\nI go outside for a walk, go buy a new phone SIM card to replace the one I destroyed...for some reason because I was suicidal...\nI call my brother, I hate talking on the phone, so I'll see him tomorrow, and tell him everything: My attempt at what many languages refer to as self-murder. My lies, my failed life I've been trying to hide. So that ought to help...that ought to give me a kick in the butt I need, instead of the noose around my neck which was just a terribly stupid idea.\n\nAlso, a few minutes later, I received an email, a job offer for a 5 month contract. Well fuck me. Life is looking up again, and I didn't do anything to deserve such kindness.\n\n\n\n\nmoral of the story: I have no idea...I tried to kill myelf, and failed, and found...not meaning to my life but a glimmer of hope, it was not my time to go.\n\nI should probably have typed all of this into notepad and delete it, and be done with it.

{"id": "12605", "text": "I've done something so terrible...My parents died young, my father abused me and killed himself and I heavily smoked weed and cigs for a decade on a poor diet for 8 years. My current self can't believe how I was living. It was complete self-destruction. I never invested in myself until I broke up with my ex 1.5 years ago. I should have done everything differently in hindsight. \n\nAfter quitting smoking and becoming extremely healthy with a beach body and so on I looked back at my past and became convinced I'm going to die soon of cancer or something else. I got extreme stress. That stress led to even more depression and anxiety. Combined with my self-hatred I turned into a suicidal mess and started to become crazy. I contacted my ex to tell her I miss her, she wrote a message back about how she has improved a lot, I was the worst dumper ever and it's over and she blocked me.\n\nIn some random impulse I made a new account and gave off an extremely suicidal vibe. I said 'fuck improving' and she became angry at that. I started crying about how I'm going to die and how I've ruined everything. She kept blocking me  and to continue talking I kept making new accounts. It's on instagram and I just did it all the time because it takes like 3 seconds and I wanted to continue the conversation while my ex wanted to end it. Didn't even realize I was being annoying or being wrong. \n\nI didn't defend myself at all. I just hated on myself while my ex joined the party and had ZERO compassion while I was used to her being this 8 year older motherly figure who always supported me. It was extremely unhealthy for me. In the end she was obviously fed up with me and told me 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. I made one more account saying 'but I did change...' Without elaborating though... And that's when she exploded. She wrote such a harsh message aimed at destroying my psyche that I completely lost it for like 5 months now. Her words kept repeating in my head all the time because I already hate myself so much and suffer from rumination. For example she said 'you'll never learn how to live your life' and that became stuck in my head as a negative mantra completely wrecking my mental health. She also told me she would never reply again. Because of her message I was feeling like 'you're a loser and no matter what you try, you'll always remain a loser, you're so inferior to everyone else and you will never amount to anything, just give up and kill yourself'... That's just so bad for someone in my situation and I really wanted her validation. \n\nI was just so frustrated at myself and her!! I didn't even tell her the full story about all the positive changes I've made and why is she so angry at me? I broke up with her because she was wasting her time on me! It wasn't meant as an attempt to get her back! And I fucking changed so much! So for months I just kept spamming her. Mostly begging her to talk it out, explaining myself, but also insulting her back. I would constantly write messages and delete them again because the insults were repeating in my head at an unbearable rate and I wanted the pain to stop at all costs. It was maddening. It was the worst form of torture anyone can experience to hear that shit repeat in your head 24/7. All my self-esteem and self-respect forever gone because of her words. She never replied to my begging and got rid of her instagram in the end \ud83d\ude13\n\nIt went wayyyyyyyyyyy too far what I did. I didn't stop for more than 4 months. My emotions have finally calmed down and now I'm moving from living in pure agony towards being a mature adult again, but I'm still thinking about this all the time. I feel such intense guilt towards my ex for getting her involved in my poor mental health. It's extremely frustrating and it feels like this has ruined my life beyond repair. I'm also terribly afraid of the legal consequences. Hopefully my ex is just glad that I've stopped contacting her for a month now because it's fucking ILLEGAL what I did. She lives on the other side of the world though...\n\nI do know that if this leaks out and the whole world knows it, I'd want to kill myself out of embarrassment and guilt. I'm so scared that this will bite me in the ass 10 years from now too... I'm very worried that my ex is so angry at me that she'll use it to destroy my life... WHAT HAVE I DONE?! I'm having therapy to work on this, but it's so expensive so I can only go once per month :(... I'm so fucked.

But to give a very vague summary, It wasn't great. I grew up without a home, had a broken family, and struggled quite a bit in school because of that alongside mental illnesses. I truly believed from the age of 12-14 that my future was either me becoming some stripper/prostitute, or being 6 feet under. Because I saw no options for me. and I KNOW someone out there reading this can somewhat relate. I know someone out there has a mental illness or life situation that makes it hard to picture a future where your life isn't complete shit. \n\nand none of this is my fault, and its not your fault either, its just unfortunate life circumstances that put us in these situations. \n\nThat being said, and here is the controversial statement\n\nI was, and still am so sick of people with savior complexes trying to lift their ego's up on \"saving me\" when really they don't give a shit. This does not apply to people who genuinely love and care for peoples well being, like you KNOW yourself and you know when you're being genuine. So this post does not apply to you. But I've had people use me for their own gain, to make themselves look like great people. I've had so many \"Friends\" make public post before saying \"Look at how great of a person I am, because I am friends with this girl who went through all of this, and I am helping her\" posting MY traumas to stroke their own dicks. Or even people who I've dated who would make their own statements or brag to their friends about dating someone like me. Had an exgirlfriend use that exact statement \"SOMEONE LIKE ME\"\n\nTo everyone in my life who has truly helped me, I love yall, and yall know who you are. But people who have been through it, we know when yall are faking it to feel good about yourself, we see right through it. \n\nFinal note: If you are in a shitty situation right now and you see no bright future. I have so much faith and belief in you that you can fucking take this head on and win. You have a chance, and you can win this fight. And once you're out of that dark tunnel, know that its YOU who did it. YOU took that challenge head on and came out. Don't let no bitch try to make some dumbass instagram post saying \"Look at what I did!\" nah bitch, you did that. \n\nIf you actually read this entire post btw, know that I love you sm. And I know some people are gonna be like \"thats so rude of you to say someones an asshole for helping you\" and its hard to explain but what these people are doing isn't help. They're milking my trauma for them to feel good and it ultimately makes me feel like shit.", "class": "non-suicide"}

At this point I'm pissed because she always does this. My grandfather then got involved, and since i can somewhat trust him, I told him i had to hide the gun, he then understood, and the situation died down.

(He does stuff like this occasionally) He said I'm bullying him. I was home alone and my parents were angry at me, texting about how bad I am. They had no clue what it was like having your parents split up then having a guy move in who constantly is using self pity to get everyone to turn on you. \n\nI was so fucking angry that no one out there got how I was feeling and I was about to snap and finally kill myself. My sister came home to hang out while I was having this breakdown and I realized though she doesn't live with us she has been out in the world a lot and knew kids just don't like parents boyfriends who move in. We talked through my bedroom door and she got me to come out of my room and I told her I'm depressed.\n\nHoly shit. It felt so good to finally tell someone.

Recently realized im some level of LGBT soup.  Life looking better (overall). Finally denied help to see what else is going on. The darkness returns. ARGHHHH**  \n\nOver 20 years ago I had issues. Lived in a high stress environment and never had time to tend to me. I was last priority. Have 2 attempts under my belt (1998 &amp; 1999). Was actively refused help, but my siblings were able to get help, as much in the world as they wanted. Boys after all have to toughen up, man up, build a bridge and get over it. Constantly bullied, constantly harassed, constantly victimized by those of power (family, school, parents, police, other \"adults\"). I built a facade, toughened up, built a bridge and turned into a person capable of turning emotions on and off like its a switch. Made me plenty of enemies. I was incapable of emotion outside of existing. I couldn't die because that's what many wanted, and *told me so*.  \n\nIn the last decade or so, realized transgender was a thing. Doesn't matter parent wise as both are now dead, still only have a handful of friends (from the era above) that understand where I was but we don't talk much anymore. I cant die now, because I'm transgender ( *insertMentalText($buzzwords-&gt;$lgbt['keywords']);* ) and that only adds the icing on the cake for those who prefer me dead. Sweet (eat that you SoB's)...  \n\nNow I've started to become a person. Oh shit, full emotions. That emotion switch is getting harder and harder to turn on and off. This is kind of cool... Nice... Finally, living not just existing for the sake of existing as a numb figure. Good big things on the horizon. Awesome. Also started to look into what some other issues I have going on. Doctors, appointments, long drives (because I live in middle of nowhere) All kinds of stuff scheduled. Things are looking up. Things are \"improving\". But, I've never had anything good without excessive cost and I didn't know what that cost was until last week and I'm not sure its even worth it anymore. My death panel called \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"insurance\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" (that I'm required to buy, by law) has denied the rest of my tests an I'm sure as hell not getting any better. Once again, as usual I gotta fight for **everything** that's ever happened (bad, mediocre, ok, or even remotely good). I'm sick of fighting, my whole life has been a fight, even for the smallest victories.  \n\nIts getting darker. That familiar darkness I've fought to overcome 20  years ago, that darkness I've succeeded in defeating is making its return, and as usual without help. I once again stand alone to fight my own darkness. Once again I've called of work because I'm sick, its probably the stress, I get sick a lot but at least my boss is a great person &amp; boss. Here I sit crying, an emotion I'm still not hugely familiar with.  \n\nI'm not suicidal right now. I have too many people to piss off.

I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday. I was telling them that I felt better, when in reality I still feel like killing myself. I just didn't want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn't give a shit. I told him that I wasn't feeling good when he asked how I was doing, and he said \"If I went to the grocery store, and asked how the clerk was doing, I expect them to say good, because that's the polite thing to do. I don't want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing\" which made no fucking sense because it's not a grocery store it's a fucking psych ward. I'm supposed to be honest with how I am feeling. After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life. He clearly didn't give a fuck. I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don't know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "3805", "text": "Bored and apathetic. I really don't know where to start here. I'm 17 years old (18 in 2 weeks) and just moved in to college. I've been really depressed for many years. I've never been very social, never had anyone I was really close to for very long. My parents are divorced, I'm not very close to either of them. Mom and I always fight, Dad cheated on her and beat me and my brother (only a few times tho). I'm also gay. \n\n I've never had any vision of what I wanted my life to be outside of high school, and I still don't. I don't care about studying or what my major is. To me, life is inherently pointless. You're born, you live, you die. Whatever career you pick doesn't matter, and whatever joy you derive from those you surround yourself with is fleeting. It's like I want to meet and interact with other people but I realize whenever I try that it really doesn't matter. I have nothing of interest to say and I don't really care what anyone else has to say. \n\nI've just been so bored and apathetic for a long time. I can remember lying in bed when I was like 8 thinking how much better my parent's lives would be if I had never existed. \n\nI've been thinking of suicide for a long time, but have never gathered the courage to go through with anything because knowing me, I'd probably fuck up any suicide attempt I'd ever make. I know everyone here is just gonna give me the usual \"you have so much to live for,\" \"it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem\" shit. I've heard all that before and it doesn't mean anything to me. I don't value money, success, material goods, or companionship so the rewards of this world mean nothing to me, and the whole appeal of suicide is its permanence. Saying that killing yourself is something that can't be undone is like telling a sex addict that girls have tits. Kind of counterproductive to what you were going for, I think. \n\nCan anyone give me any reason to go on, because I just don't care about anything, or anyone, including myself?

{"id": "1512", "text": "For everyone who came here looking for help.This is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days, yes we all know, one of THOSE days. Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking \"risks\" and with risks comes \"reward\". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.\n\nI would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?.....  How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being \"unhappy\"? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being \"unhappy\" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. \n\nEven now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be \"unhappy\" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being \"unhappy\" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you \"happy\". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far.  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, \"happiness\". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle. Of which we have named, \"Depression and happiness\".", "class": "suicide"}

She's laying on her side, still feeling it. I'm scared and worried but trying to focus on her and her needs right now. \n\nSuicide prevention line has already been called, they will check back in at 7. \n\nShe won't talk to her family, not ready for that. \n\nMy mom is aware and will Calle back at 730. \n\nI will call the police if she gets away from or seriously hurts me or herself or gets a weapon.\n\n\n I'm trying\n\n\nI don't know what to do. And I'm scared. \n\n5 minutes at a time.\n\nGf is half asleep.  Scared and on reddit ... fuck\n\n\nEdit, 1024pm pst, we are still here. Both exhausted, we had some dinner, I had more trouble keeping it down then she did, I laid down for a minute (even been able to go the bathroom and take out the trash and she hasn't been trying anything). Now we are both just laying down on a futon she's half asleep, I'm just here next to her. I will try and get some sleep soon, I will need it for tomorrow.  \n\nThanks to anyone who had something to say. It's obvious but I needed it as much as she did. It's corny to say by right now I love you guys, just because it's such joy to know that other people care and want to say so. Thanks again.\n\nNow we see how tomorrow will go.\n\nEdit #2, 705am,\n\nIt's the next morning.  She's been asleep since ten the night before. I maybe got three to four hours myself. \n\nI know the focus should be her and her needs. I know I should focus on the time in front of me. \n\n... but I am absolutely  terrified of the times yet to come. Like Monday when I have to go to work. Or Thursday night when I'm coming home. A week past that, and do on. I don't know what day if any is where I come home and find something terrible or worse nothing at all and she's gone. \n\nI know I will fight for her as long as I can. But I am wrecked by all this. \n\nEdit #3, 1020am\n\nI have been calling around all morning to various mental health and emergency counseling services. There's not much that can be done on the weekend though. There are a couple options but they all rely on her giving consent to treatment (since she has yet to succeed in hurting herself or others). \n\nThat doesn't seem likely right now. She is a very depressed and exhausted state. She has not pulled herself out of the bed all morning, has not eaten anything. I was shock that she took her birth control pill though) somewhere around 6-7am when I was asleep or in the bathroom. Maybe its a sing, I don't know.\n\nEither way, I have family coming to my place but it takes time (I live to hours away from anyone I actually know outside of work), she still wont talk to her family at all. \n\nI have the number for an emergency hotline if she wants to talk, or preferably if she consents to any kind of treatment we will go in for observation and consoling.\n\nRight now I'm just working out my own fears, hence why I'm still here updating this thing. \n\nI'm scarred about Monday, I'm scarred of coming home from work five days from now an the apartment is empty and I never see or hear from her again. I've tried telling her that, I don't know if it helps or not. So I just try to reiterate that I'm here for here and love her. \n\nwhat I dont tell her is how scared I am about rent, and that  we were 1 month in to our 12 month lease that between us could only afford half each (FUCK ME SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK, oh god please help). I'm telling myself not to worry about that or money right now. It shouldn't be the focus, she needs to be taken care of first. I'm trying to hold onto that. \n\nFor anyone still reading this, thanks, I'm sorry its written like shit, but yeah, this is for me at this point too. \n\nEdit #4, 1133am\n\nMy mom made it to my apartment, I feel kinda bad about that because I desperately needed another person here with me but the gas and travel costs ... bt I'm not supposed to worry about that at all, let alone right now.\n\nAnyway, my GF is still in bed, in the aftermath of what happened last night. Depression, shame maybe, either way its a wall where she has cocooned herself behind for now. I'm just here waiting, getting some of the help I need. Getting what  resources I can together, what information I can. \n\nSo now its waiting, when my GF asks for the help, I want to be there and hopefully I have the right pieces to enable some healing and after care.\n\nEdit #5, 253pm\n\nSo my mom left, she talked with my gf for a couple hour and a half. It seemed to help some. Gf final got up, got a shower, ate some food. \n\nRight now we're just in bed together,  hurt but together.\n\nStill here still trying.\n\nEdit #6, 543pm\n\nMy gf has had a minor relapse, it's not as violent as the previous night but she is severely depressed and saying she feels empty and hopeless. \n\nI am here for her all the same, sitting next to her on the couch. Saying what feels right and trying to keep how much she is loved in sight. I have had her read few messages of yours/pm'ed my way, they have been mostly helpful and reached her a little. I thank anyone for those messages, I don't say it lightly that right now I love you all. \n\nThis editing and updating is more for me than her right now. Hopefully  things can get some momentum and reaching out for help or treatment becomes something she wants. \n\nIf she gets violent again, I have to call the police. I don't know how I can handle another bad episode like that.  \n\nStill here still trying \n\nEdit #7, 1039pm\n\nSo we hit a low point, again. \n\nShe smacked me, tried smothering me with a blanket, and may or may not have tried jumping if a second story balcony ... but i got to her fast enough. Tackled her to the floor. It was then she broke and hit what I can only describe as rock bottom.\n\nShe cried for an hour. She couldn't stop apologizing. But she also was than willing to talk, we called a hotline and talked things over for an hour. \n\nThings gave calmed down a bit. We are on the couch, watching tv. She actually laughed at some things we are watching. \n\nI don't know what this means for later, or days from now. But ... feels like I can rest a little easier for now. We will see where this goes. \n\nEdit #8, 601pm (Sunday),\n\nSo things are ... interesting. \n\nI was way more troubled and scarred this morning than I ever would have thought. I was stirred up bad and scared. I cried for an hour and half. I called a crisis management line, that helped some but there wasn't much else to say or talk about. \n\nMy GF was up, but sluggish and obviously very depressed. We tried showering together but it was short and a little awkward (it normally isn't obviously). I broke down again when we were done, in her depression my GF was talking about not wanting to be alive and it floored me. After two nights I was just messed up. I cried and begged for her to seek out help, she wasn't happy to have to deal with my mess on top of her own. She yelled no at me and ran upstairs to bed.\n\nI had to leave, crying I told her to call me if she needed to, but I had to leave the apartment. I went for a fifteen minute walked, called my mom again, calmed down some. Came to the realization that I was so messed up and couldn't see it because I was projecting it all on my GF. \n\nI came back home, it was fairly quiet. We didn't talk much. We went to lunch (used a coupon for a free smoothie). things were okay. We thought about trying to go out for frozen yogurt (its hot as balls) but that didn't work out as it was way too crowded to deal with. \n\nWe came back home, my GF cried for about  thirty minutes and was talking to me again about what had happened. We cuddled for a while. \n\nOverall things are a little better, but its certainly a road to recovery. Among other issues that cause us both anxiety (like getting a new job altogether .... fuck).\n\nAnyway, I believe this should be my last update. The story has been told and now I'm in a place where I need to work on myself as much as try to be supportive to my GF. \n\nI can't express how happy I am that anyone responded with encouragement. Hopefully this little blog can be a window into what happens when some shit really hits the fan and things fall apart. Maybe it helps.\n\nStill here, still trying, have to work on myself some too. \n\nLove you guys.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "5332", "text": "Another day...Every so often, I wake up feeling okay. I wake up being properly afraid of dying. Feeling like I want to keep going, like I want to see what the future holds, what I can do with my life. I feel positivity, I feel... like things are going well. Like there's a way for things to improve. It's a nice feeling. It's a rare feeling.\n\nMost of the rest of the time, I wouldn't be too terribly upset if a stray bullet flew through my window and tore my head open. I suppose... I don't really want to do it myself more often than not, but... I'm more afraid of the pain I'd go through than anything. And I'm fucking terrified of the mess other people would have to clean up afterwards. Corpse disposal, funeral arrangements, the writing of an obituary, the trauma my family would go through, having to sell my belongings... Hell, I probably wouldn't even have the right name on my headstone.\n\nToday's one of the shockingly common days where I'm just... Wandering around my home. Aimlessly. Sobbing, mostly unclothed because my air conditioner is broken and I'm too broken to even try to get it fixed. Can't... think clearly enough. Managed to make dinner somehow. I want to kill myself. But there aren't any meds in my house that'd cause a deadly interaction or a deadly overdose effect, and there's no way to use any sort of gas to asphyxiate myself, and I'm sure I'd be too much of a coward to do it anyway if there were either. I want this to end.\n\nI'm sitting here, resting firmly in two thirds of Cluster C, with enough people in my head that killing myself would be murder to boot, and I honestly... Can't function. There's... Fuck. I don't know. I can't leave the house. I can't talk to people. I was supposed to be this... Maybe not a perfect person, but... There were expectations I was supposed to meet.\n\nI was supposed to be okay at school, I was supposed to have a college degree and a functioning career, I was supposed to not be queer, I was supposed to be at least somewhat healthy, I was supposed to... Whatever. Not be... This. I don't even know who told me these things but fucking god fucking damn it this... Pressure?? I don't know where it's coming from, I just know it's there and i can't get rid of it. Not without a support network. And because of my problems, my support network consisted of all of one person, who's gone now, pursuing her own life goals. Everyone else just walks away. It's been too long since I've even been hugged.\n\nI've been living alone for years. I might as well be dead already. I just want this to end. I don't care if that happens because it suddenly gets better or because I finally manage to do it, but I want it to change.", "class": "suicide"}

I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like \"unneeded\" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my \"spark\". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or \"I know I'm all these things, but so are you\" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop. I'm currently working on a song for him, It's been a really long writing process but I think it's coming along well. Anyway, thanks for reading that whole long winded thing, :)", "class": "non-suicide"}
{"id": "1213", "text": "Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. \n\nHowever i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. \n\nOf course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.\n\nThe grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.\n\nWhen class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **\"It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!\"** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.\n\nI talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?\n\nIf you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.\n\nTLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.\n\n Thanks for reading this rant I just had to vent a little.", "class": "non-suicide"}

{"id": "7289", "text": "I Wish I Had Never Been BornI wish my parents had one child, not two.\n\nI'm very lonely. Almost every day I cry myself to sleep because of how lonely I feel. \n\nI have a lot of things to be thankful for. I have food and shelter. Clean drinking water.\n\nBut I'm very lonely. It's almost like a physical pain. I feel like an alien on Earth. I go through about my day and enact certain behaviours that will make me appear like a normal member of society. But I'm deeply broken inside. \n\nI am turning 26 in two months and I think I have led a good life. 26 years is a long time. I never thought I would see my 25th birthday.\n\nI have always been a loner. Alone. I have trouble making friends. I had a few friends since high school but we've drifted apart ever sense. I used to struggle a lot with loneliness and I've put myself out there. Talked to people. Worked on being positive. Joined clubs. Tried new things. Get new jobs.\n\nBut everything is external. I know that everything I do - it is an act. I will write two letter when I end it. One of them is for my dad. I want to thank him for supporting me even though I didn't turn out well. I want to tell him that it is for the best and the end is inevitable. I want to thank him and tell him that when it comes to it, my departure is not something to grieve over because I would never amount to anything in life. It is better to end it now before I become a bigger burden.\n\nIn a way, it is the best time to end it. In my letter, I hope to convey to my family that my existence should have never happened in the first place. I have a darkness within myself and I'm always very, very lonely. I have no one. There was no other reason that I was brought to this world.\n\nI have cried many days and nights over this decision, but I think it's for the best. I have nothing to offer to the world. I am nothing. I used to cry and long for someone to love and hold me, but I've finally reached peace with the realization that there is reason that I will never find it. I'm very grateful for all the gestures of kindness I've received in this life. They meant a lot to me. The reason that I've always been a loner all my life is because I am not a person who can have it. Why would anyone love and care about me? The reason that is that I should have never been born. \n\nI'm really glad that I was able to make something of my life that would make me somewhat a productive member of society. I'm very lucky. But I have to end it. Because this is it. I'm sorry for the pain that my family will go through. But I hope they understand that I've arrived at this decision because it is the right thing. If I were to prolong my time on this Earth, there is nothing else for me other than being a greater burden. This is a good thing. \n\nI'm glad that I've experienced my 25th birthday. It was good. 26 years is a long time. Thank you.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "5084", "text": "I need to vent.To start, i'm 20 years old and i'd grade myself as severely depressed. It started i guess when i was 13. My family owned a restaurant and my brother and i were always there helping. My step dad hired an apprentice(josh) who was young at the time, but the main part is josh didn't feel like an apprentice he felt like family. He used to take me out driving with him and would always let me play with his phone when work was boring for me. I was attending my first year of highschool at the time, and woke up one morning to have my parents with tears in their eyes tell me that josh was involved in a traffic accident and was killed.. This absolutely destroyed me. He was a role model to me and one of my closest friends. After this happened i noticed that my family wasn't as close any more. My step dad got increasingly quieter and my life consisted of school and the restaurant. I don't want to give you my whole sap story but i wanted to end it when i was 14-16. And tried a few times. I decided to talk to somebody and get help. and it worked briefly... \n\nWhere i am now is just as much of a shitfest. In the last two years, i've been living in my states capitol because i'm looking for work. I haven't been able to hold a stable job this whole time and have currently been unemployed for almost 5 months.. I'm on medication but  it doesn't seem to work either, as soon as my course is over and the doctor says i'm fine i get all the feels back. I don't want a pill in the morning to decide how i'm going to feel for today. Am i destined to just keep eating ssri's hopeful in that they'll work? :/\nThe only thing keeping me here is my girlfriend. People i considered my best friends for 5+years never talk to me. people i've made friends with here are the same. I feel like an inconvenience really, i'll go out of my way to see people and do things for them but it's rarely mutual like that.. I have no idea what the fuck i want to do with my life, i used to have ambitions and goals and determination but now i feel empty. My girlfriend is working at the moment and i get myself into the same slum of applying for countless jobs only to have them reply \"you have been unsuccessful\" I remember when i was a teenager i made a pact to kill myself by my late 20's if i didn't have the hint of a successful future. And recently i've been fantasizing about killing myself while driving on the highway.. just running into a barrier at 100kms an hour would do the trick. And the fantasies are becoming more frequent.

I don't want to make it sound like I'm being bullied. People like me and they were just goofing around but they honestly don't know what they're saying. I was legit considering it. I always am.\n\nI stopped joking about depression. I stopped talking about not feeling too well or being down. I'll never talk about how I'm doing anymore.

I already skipped classes on my first day, that's how much I care about getting a degree at this point. I want to drop out but I don't have anything else in life. I have no friends outside of my job that pays me shit, I don't have any talents or skills, I have no real world experience as I've been living in my parents basement for the past 3 or so years. If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.", "class": "suicide"}

I drove a lot of my old friends away from chronic alcoholism, and just feel disconnected from people. I eventually quit drinking, and things got better for a bit, but nothing great happened.

She told me that she has found easy methods of killing herself, and that this might be her last week. I always tell her things like \"We all need you, and love you\" or \"The world would be so different without you\" and \"Without you I'd be nothing\" but I can never convince her. \n\nI have never been so scared, I am worried about her safety and would do anything for her to get better. I don't know how to talk to or how delicate I should be to people who have depression. Is there something I can do as an individual to help her? \n\nSome extra info; she has been using ProZac for a little under a month, she says it helps but clearly she is still having active thoughts of suicide, so I'm not so sure. She has an appointment with a therapist in March I believe, but I don't know how much time she has left.\n\nAny help will do, I just want my sister to be OK.", "class": "suicide"}

First off I'm extremely lonely, there's a girl I'm interested in but I know for sure that even if I were to confess how I felt to her, it wouldn't work out because I'm a garbage human, I've been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time I've ever had a S/O was in high school, but then again she had autism so she most likely didn't care about me romantically. Then there was the other attempt I had at telling someone how I felt, and she though said that she loved me, left me to rot afterwards. So you can see where I'm getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time. There's that, and there's also that I'm an artist, and that's been dragging me down lately too, since I keep drawing but I never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice, well gee, nothing is getting better so it OBVIOUSLY ISN'T WORKING!\nI'm just sick of it, I don't even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday.

This is for a friend of mine (he's eating my head over this, and wanted some advice, so thought I'd ask the more experienced crowd over here).\n\nGreat, now let's get to the post.\n\nSo a friend of mine started to rly like this girl who lives across the world from him (told me about 9 hrs from where he lives in TZ terms), but rly wants to confess to her (idk why, since I know he's getting rejected anyway based on his description of her and his personality).\n\nAlso, fun fact he did tell me, they've not even had a video call until now (apparently she's kinda scared abt it as far as he told me.)\n\nSo he took it to the levels where he did write an entire essay-worthy proposal letter and asked me to rate it. I have no idea about such stuff, so thought I could give him advice from other people with much better advice than I could give. So just give any advice on whether this pseudo-proposal I'm pasting below is any worth (P.S. read the thing and apparently she's already in a relationship, but he still wants to try, so ig that exists?)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey, idk why I'm posting this at this time of the hour, but I really want to get this off my chest before it starts to mess around my head and I die of an anxiety attack.\n\nI've probably said this about a million times in this convo of ours, but ever since this started, I've probably never felt better in my life in terms of emotional state, and never expected a random DM of appreciation could go such a long way in terms of having a good social relationship.\n\nBut I think I'm starting to like you a lot. Now I can't justify anything I could do for you over your bf, who you've probably known for well over a couple of years, instead of trusting a dude over the internet you met pretty recently, but all I can say is that what I say comes from the bottom of my heart.\n\nWe might be polar opposites in every aspect of our lives, from food likings to music to pretty much anything. But you know what, I'm fine with that. I could enjoy anything as long as someone close to I endear loves it too and takes a personal interest in it. I'm ok in having petty fights over such silly stuff as long as we don't take it too seriously. Does help with having social contact in my opinion, but it's kinda what kept me here for so long.\n\nI really don't even expect you to agree to any of this at this point. I kinda have come to terms with being solo in my life, but you know what, I kinda want to keep talking to you. Irdk why I would've ever said that, but turns out it is kinda true. Maybe it's just my kinda toxic relationship with people and where I was taken for granted. But just this simple talking is all that I rly love about us. I rly can't ever say I can treat you like a princess like most girls expect, but I guess I could do something which might be one better, have one loyal subject, always at your service or help and do whatever I could for you.\n\nBut hey, I just wanted to say this, and I rly don't mind getting friend-zoned at this point, but I still want to keep talking to you. Sry if I have ever done anything wrong in the past, but I just wanted to say this. I rly do like and love you. Just hope we could keep this forever, and at a more personal level. I rly don't force you to any of this, but just don't walk away from my life after giving me so much hope to live life to the fullest again.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nP.S.

This makes it a lot more difficult to support her. \n\nLately she has been saying so much scary shit like \"maybe I should to prepare you\", \"Promise me to stay strong and live if anything happens to me\", \"Why are you so worried? I'll take care of you from heaven\" etc. Yesterday she admitted that she almost jumped from the balcony the night before and that she has pills in her room for period cramps and she doesn't trust herself with them. The same day when we went to bed she said \"be strong tonight\", and I freaked out. She lives with her parents and they make everyone shut off the phones and turn off the wifi every night (despite my girlfriend being 23, it's weird...) so I couldn't call her. I just cried and hoped that she would be here the next morning.\n\nToday I woke up by a text from her, thank god, but thing don't look good. She keeps telling me to \"be strong\" and saying \"I love you\". If I ask her 3 questions, she'll answer maybe one. I've been telling her all morning how much I love her, how I wanna be there for her and listen to her, help her etc. She's basically just saying \"I love you\" and \"I'm gonna isolate now.\". Now she told me \"you can go and be with your friends\". So communicating with her is difficult. I asked her a few times directly if she's thinking about killing herself, and I think she said \"I don't know\". \n\nI don't know what the hell to do. I'm so scared that she might attempt again (the last attempt was about 1 year ago as far as I know). \n\nHer parents don't know we're together (they're homophobic) and don't know me very well, but I have her parents' shared phone number. I've been thinking about texting them like \"I'm worried about your daughter, please keep an eye on her\". The thing that's making me doubt it is the fact that the mom is verbally abusive to my girlfriend and one of the reason's she's suicidal, and the dad doesn't do much to stop it. And my girlfriend has said that she doesn't want me to call/text them and that she's afraid I'm gonna call them. \n\nI don't want her to die. If she did, I think I'd wanna kill myself too.

The FULL version. 37 complete pages of everything I\u2019ve saved since 2017.\n\nAnd today our neighbor informed my mom that my stalker has officially been issued a [No-Contact Order](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-protective-restraining-orders-3354203) by her commander.\n\nDefinition:\n\n\u201cNo contact orders are like the restraining order in the civilian world. These orders are issued to protect the safety of another person or of several people. It could be issued if a person in authority suspects inappropriate actions by someone in their command.\u201d\n\nThis means... I am free. Finally. I\u2019m 19, and the person who\u2019s forced herself to be the focal point of my life since I was 14 is finally gone.\n\nEven if she tries something again - it will definitely be the last time because she will get in SERIOUS trouble. This is essentially the military version of a restraining order.\n\nI\u2019m so happy for the neighbors who practically saved us. My heart was heavy thinking I\u2019d have to return to this subreddit with bad news. But this is great news. I\u2019m FREE!", "class": "non-suicide"}

{"id": "10836", "text": "Just Getting this off my Chest.I'm not suicidal...nor am I any danger of killing myself but I often think about it and I often see it in the media. I was spurred on to make this post and try to discuss my current problem after seeing the episode of Family Guy where Brian and Stewie got locked in the bank vault and Brian admits he thinks about killing himself because his life has no meaning.  Oddly enough, I can relate and worse still I know I could never go through with it because I would be proving everyone in my life right and just end up another statistic that some sick bastard would use to make their political agenda fit whatever narrative they wanted to bring up.\n\nAnd I know where all of this shit in my life stems from. I know where the depression comes from, I know where my feelings of inadequacy and inability to even know what love or happiness feels like anymore came from. It all came from my mother. \n\nI grew up in the Southern States to an moderately affluent family, nothing in the 1%er range more between 180k to 200k combined a year depending on the overtime my father worked or company bonuses my mother gained. My father was an educated male from the baby boomer generation who never went to college and started work at a factory and eventually made manager; my mother was college educated, got a master's and while she loves my father is so married to her career that she no longer separates from her life. She's one of the heads of security for a nuclear power plant and controls a lot of employees.\n\nWhen I was little, it wasn't so bad but my parents were very authoritarian and it wasn't uncommon for myself, a child that they thought had ADHD thanks to a food allergy to red-dye that made me hyperactive, but I eventually grew out of, to be beaten or spanked. I cut my own switches, face soaked with tears as I didn't even understand what I did wrong or why I was behaving the way I was. I screamed in pain as only a 6-9 year old boy can when my father took a leather belt more than inch thick to my backside. \n\nIt got worse as I went into schooling and while I was thankfully taken to a psychiatrist and medical professional who kept my parents from medicating me and giving me a more selective diet it didn't stop my teachers from giving them 'behavioral grades' on a daily basis. If I got anything below a B I was spanked. I remember several days at school as a child where I had been spanked by my mother or father that the day after I couldn't sit comfortable at all. My little baby ass was almost perptually bruised during that time of my life and even as they did this. My mother would constantly tell me, \"no one will ever you love you like we do. No one.\"\n\nI bought into it, thought my parents were telling the truth, that their form of love was the best and it would never get any better. I began to associate the pain with affection but I always felt cold and empty. Next came the days of actual learning and challenge in school, when they asked well what do you want to be. Of course I got the speil about I could be anything I wanted to be and being from a very religious family, I was told that God had put me on this planet for a very, very special reason.\n\nI could never figure out that reason. I never knew what I wanted to do and frequently changed my ideas. I used to want to make video games, to entertain people and make up magnificent stories. I was usually told that I could do it, but it was silly and meaningless. I was constantly pushed towards engineering but eventually went to college for a communications degree. \n\nYet, the idea that I was meant to be something more always stuck with me, but my overly religious upbringing and the fact that my parents raised me more than 10 miles away from the next house beyond my Grandparents meant I was officially isolated from the outside world beyond school hours for more than 8 years. You know...the years where most social skills and learning habits develop?\n\nI grew up socially stunted, constantly compared to my much older and social butterfly of a brother. I didn't date and was constantly questioned and even threatened about my sexuality. I was unable to choose if I was a churchgoer or not and constantly rammed from service to service, mission trip to mission trip and ostracized from the other children by age because I was never around. I was the outsider, the person they didn't know about.\n\nAt school it was much the same, I wasn't to be associated with. I was the unknown and bounced from one side of the city to the other, never able to make a reperior with anyone until I finally got into High school. It's only now that I look back that I realize I was just an object of convenience for those friends as well.  I was bullied and beaten by my peers until I hit a growth spurt in earlier high school and joined the football team. I got larger, more muscular and attractive and gained a 'family' in the form of the team from an outside prospective. In reality I had just traded one set of abusers for another. My teammates often molested me, fought with me and would do everything in their power to make the couches punish me in some fashion. Most of the couches knew it was going on but allowed it for team cohesion. \n\nBy the way, I don't mean they just spanking my ass. I mean my teammates would bear hug me while they were naked and rub their genitals against my body. Many would grab my testicles and play with them or act like they were jerking me off in the middle of changing. It was all a big joke to them and when it's 1 on 40 you tend to just let it happen so you don't lose your teeth. I had already stood up for myself once in middle school for the same behavior from the football team. I ended up in the hospital with a major concussion when I was tombstoned into the floor of the lockerroom and left alone, screaming in pain as I went blind from the impact and couldn't even move my legs. I crawled dumbly across the floor, crying like a bitch because I couldn't even make my toes move until I finally got through the door by some miracle and a couch got me up from my feet to sit me down and wait for an ambulance. I saw a picture later, there was so much blood on my face and body that it looked like someone had cut me open from the middle of my stomach to the crown of my head.\n\nIt's been many years, but I still remember that the only punishment the team received was extra exercises for the week.\n\nI remembered back then, knowing that i would never be the physical specimens of many of them and most of my bullies, I just remembered thinking that I show them with my brain, that I'd excel and make something and make more money and do something special. I'm in the work force now, 1000 miles from home, working for an older, more narciassistic version of my mother, publishing bullshit pseudo-science I don't believe onto social media and writing their copy and advertisements for them and I know that I'm a failure at life.  Not because I didn't try and not because I made bad choices, but because myself and so many others were doomed to fail from the start.\n\nWe're abused and battered and shown time and time again that people who are born certain ways or in certain places are just better than us and can abuse us because of that fact. We're shown it with people who are born into money, we're shown it with people who are born with more athetic talent or with anyone who has more sex appeal or anything else that makes them 'special' to the rest of the world. \n\nIt hit me how true it was in college and it's stuck with me since. Since leaving school, I've been sexually harassed by co-workers at more than 3 employers at least a dozen if not more times. In college, I was raped by a 'female friend' who I had trusted and got me too intoxicated to turn her down. She then privately spread anonymous images of my junk across the campus and complained about my 'inability to perform' to several other people on campus, creating a wide spread rumor mill and killing any ability I had to find a signifcant other.  Campus claimed they couldn't track down the origin and that I \"Shouldn't complain about the incident even if it did happen.\"\n\nI thought moving across the country would help, but I ended up in a soul crushing location, grinding day after day and doing the same thing at work. While my all-female co-workers treat me like a beast of burden, blame every mistake in the company on me and act as if my presence is a sin. Day after day I'm reminded that I'm an 'other' in the office, but I have no where to go anymore.  I can't return home since my family told me I was not welcome in the house hold anymore now that I was old enough to support myself and I don't have the money to just quit my job and start a new job hunt. I continue looking for jobs but it's the same thing that most people suffer from still. \"Not enough applicable experience.\" for even the most basic of positions. \n\nI know this got overly long and ranty, since I spent the better part of twenty minutes writing this. It made me feel better at least.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "4042", "text": "Warning: Suicide (Nobody will read this)My name is William and I am 23 years old. I have a mental illness. I suffer from depression, I have anxiety and I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. What lead to me to this point of suicide is loliness overall. I see and feel the loliness I suffer everyday. I have no support system and have been battling it all on my own through restless nights and empty days. I attempt to go out in public and can see that people don't wanna be near me. They look at me like I'm some kind of animal. That's why I have this alternative to take the time and tell you my story here online. The things I feel to some might be confusing and disturbing to some people which is understandable. Some people say they may care about me when I feel the exact opposite and they more, or less resent me more than anything. I have had experiences where I have voluntarily admitted myself for psychiatric help and got nothing out of it, but the mistreatment of the staff. I have called the National Suicide Prevention lifeline services and was told on numerous occasions believe or not to \"hang up\" because I was only emotionally distraught instead of being actively suicidal in that moment with only the thoughts of suicide building through my mind before and after those experiences. Between my past traumatic history and current life has left me depressed with the thoughts of unworthiness, uselessness, unwilling, and now suicidal. I get angry, sad and cry to myself, and  then the feelings repeat itself in a vicious cycle. I feel the urge to self harm a lot and use weapons and leverage on myself to put myself in complete danger. When I'm around good people that want to help and for example I get a negative attitude because I'm going through so much and feel overwhelmed. I tend to violently snap and perform violent activities on myself and possibly others if physically someone was around which I know I'm more than capable of hurting and possibly killing someone. I've been exposed to a lot of fucked up shit. I couldn't handle it alone and till this day I feel alone even though someone out there might be experiencing pain of their own, but as a victim to society, as a vicitim of my own I don't see that because I'm caught up in my own problems and imprisoned by my mind. I am not a very socialized individual and my actions speak for me. As I said I don't have the support and I have no family, or friends. Unfortunately I've had more bad luck than good where people don't want to acknowledge my existence as a human being first and look at me and even mistreat me like a cancer to society. At 23 years of age I've pretty much experienced it all since the beginning of my childhood. I'm not gonna write about all my past traumatic experiences only for the simple fact is I'm feeling anxious at this very moment. I've been through the heart aches, I've been apart of violence and devolped an explosive and destructive temper because of it and violent tendencies whenever I feel lonely and sad. At least I acknowledge I have been through enough where you would think some kinda high ups or \"anarchy\" is watching me to know enough I've been through enough and paid it with my heart and soul.  Moments where I was in life threatening situations to being in what is known as a life threatening situation, but by my own device. I have health issues. I've had injuries caused by certain events that transpired in my youth. I'll give you an example: Whenever I get anxious like I have been, and my anxiety shoots up, I get like a shock wave in my legs, my jaw sometimes feels wired shut, my arms start to shake, or sometimes if it gets really bad, I throw up and cough up blood in my lungs. As far as those restless nights? I go to sleep for the most part with something always on my mind that's occurimg. It's most likely a flashback of a traumatic event I went through and I toss and turn and wake up all alone with cold sweats and I sometimes scream and breathe heavy. Normally I would use Reddit as my last cry for help, but in my experience between the real world and online as far as getting and receiving emotional support had been a bust. I have had more assholes and judgmental people if anything. I think it's because people just don't want to deal with the burden of me.

I shouldn't feel this way at 20 but what choice do I have? I do not have any family that I know of except for my brother and father, but I truly hate them for who they are. So I am pretty much done. This life just is not worth it to me and I know that it is selfish to clock out early but, again, what choice do I have?", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "5407", "text": "At what point is it better to die than to live this way?I've been struggling with this condition for 8 months now, with no sign of recovery.\n\n90% of my waking life my mind is blank: completely devoid of mental activity. It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness. Additionally, my short term and long-term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and (simply put) think are at an atrociously low level. My brain has a complete absence of mental activity. This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain; but almost all the time my mind is completely blank, like a zombie. In a sense, I\u2019m mentally catatonic, like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb: just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness. Every moment I\u2019m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness. When not stimulated by loud music, video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I \u201czone out.\u201d My mind is completely empty; there is no thought whatsoever. \n\nThis brings me to my memory issues (both short and long term); trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort. Sometimes I'll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch, but memories are scattered and non-linear. Trying to remember something that happened a day ago, a week ago, or a year ago feels the same. There is just no clarity of memory.\n\n I feel perpetually \"spaced out\", my mind feels foggy, as though I'm in a dream or under the influence of some substance. I feel awake yet not awake, sleepy although im physically fully awake. I have trouble with social interaction because I just don't know what to say most of the time. Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response, just to look normal because otherwise there'd be nothing I have to say. The times I do have something to speak up on, I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence. There are times where I'll just mentally blank out mid-utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next. I feel like I'm just existing in this one moment, with no past, no connection to the present, and no future.\n\nI'd rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person.", "class": "suicide"}

I keep my space clean and organized. These things are all so hard but I make sure every day things are taken care of.\n\nPeople tend to like me but I isolate myself. Many people care about me but I never do anything social because I feel out of place doing anything with anyone. \n\nI have a very loving family who will do anything to help. It hurts me to know how much stress I've caused my family and others, and how much pain my death will cause to my family and so many others.\n\nI have increasingly severe depression and anxiety I've lived with since probably birth or very early childhood. They've led to other mental health problems. I've learned very well how to hide them so I appear to the casual onlooker to be doing ok.\n\nI've made 6 genuine suicide attempts in the past few months. I've tried so many therapists and so many psychiatric medications. Still working with a therapist and using several medications.\n\nI'm so young and if I keep fighting I know I can pull through this and create a decent life for myself and do a lot of good in this world.\n\nBut I'll likely continue trying to kill myself until it works despite all the professionals and everyone else who have tried to help.\n\nI'll probably fail my attempt tomorrow and end up in another mental hospital. I've been spending lots of time in those lately.\n\nI feel so guilty. But I'm just exhausted.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "12833", "text": "WHAT'S UP FELLOW KIDS! How'd you like to join a totally normal Minecrafter server that just happens to be modded? Please. We're board and need more people on the server. The server itself is already paid for, so you just need to install the mods!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this seems like a lot, but honestly, setting everything up takes AT MOST 30 minutes. If you're interested, DM me and read the stuff below! We have up to 60 open slots on the server at a time and a discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DISCORD CODE:** HTmwmv\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey! Our server is a modded Minecrafter server that uses mods designed to run on the latest version of Forge. We have several mods including an advanced electrical mod, Flan's gun mod, Modern Warfare mod, nuclear mod and several more! The server is a psuedo-roleplay where you take on the role of a specific country. You can be any country you want, as long as it isn't taken and you must follow the rules below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic or the like. Really, just don't be a dick.\n* If you want to have an official war with someone, YOU MUST DECLARE IT IN THE UN MEETINGS. (yes, we have a UN tower that's a work in progress)\n* Don't harass other players\n* Have fun\n* Feel free to use the nukes, but don't nuke the UN. That is safe grounds\n* For heaven's sake, and for the sake of all that's holy, DON'T USE THE F!@#ING BALEFIRE BOMB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BASES:**\n\nWhen you join in, we'll either let you go into creative for 30 minutes to build a base, or we might give you the materials, as some of the materials are a little OP. Feel free to build bases away from the UN, but you should have one near the UN, preferably your main one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PC REQUIREMENTS:**\n\nI can run the server pretty well with a 64 bit system and 8 GB of ram. You don't need a high-end computer, but you really can't have one that's too slow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\nI should note that we do use a service called Forge for the mods. The server is already set up. You are not paying for anything, if anything you're just installing the Forge client which allows your Minecraft app to interpret the mods. Forge is not malware, it is a documented and highly reliable service. If you don't believe me, google it! If you don't already have it you WILL HAVE TO INSTALL FORGE. For some reason having to put in 10 minutes worth of work is a turnoff for some people... **IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS OR GET STUCK, ASK ME!**", "class": "non-suicide"}
