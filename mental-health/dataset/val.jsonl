{"id": "11987", "text": "Long post incoming. Sorry, it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid, I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out, and I stayed up all night, managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book, constantly having to re-read paragraphs, ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for \"later\" - and a book that should not take longer than a week, takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying, too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much, so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy, introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends, I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came, I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it, I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time, dropping out of 3 different majors (Chinese studies, law and computer science) because they ended up not feeling right for me, and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October, since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career, but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office, where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours, then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep - day, after day, after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself, saving up for traveling, which is what I dream of doing, is off the table.

I cannot leave here and just follow the fate I want. I was born condemned to events I never asked to experience, and doomed to awful feelings I never asked to feel. Friends or entertainments can ease my constant pain of being alive, but these things will never completely save me. Time stops, and suddenly, years go by, and there you are, stagnant, with no one to help or support you. Or at least that is what happens to me. I do not help myself and I never will, because at first I do not even deserve the \"blessing\" of life. My life will have no direction and no happiness. it is not worth working so hard if I already know my miserable fate. What I can do for now is anything mundane or banal to my life. Smoking, drinking, mutilating myself, getting sick. Whatever. Turns out I will not have a future, and if I do, I will simply embarrass my family, or I will be in a hospital bed recovering from a failed suicide attempt, or I will be alone, completely poor and depressed. I do not want to live anymore but at the same time I do not want to feel like a burden for the rest of my life. I want to try to commit suicide, but I will probably fail at that too. Sometimes I think nobody actually wants to die. Nobody wants to forever mark the story of everyone who went through their lives in such a morbid way. But there is not another way. Abandoned people just want to end the pain, they want to be at least reasonably happy, but what is the point of trying to be happy if I will never reach complete happiness... what is the point of trying to insist on living, if there is not and there will never be happiness in my story? Actually, I love life, or at least I used to love it... I love human beings. I want to be sweet, kind, joyful, I want to love and be loved. Deep down I love life. But life does not love me back. And now I hate it. Then I live with unilateral loves. I mean all kinds of love. And I managed to fail in all kinds of loves I have known in my life. It hurts a lot to have to live without a will. I do not want living to be an obligation anymore. No one cares about my existence and I will never have any meaning to anyone, I do not and will never mean anything. I at least wanted someone to actually love me and admire me for who I am. I am in a long process of acceptance, and in it I am trying to accept that I mean a lot less than I imagine. I am aware that I am absolutely nothing, but I need too accept it. And it is going to be painful to get over it. I have no value as a human being, and I will try to be strong enough to accept my reality, even if it costs me my own sanity.In the end, living really sucks more than I thought. I am a burden and my existence is meaningless", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "10246", "text": "Hello my name is thomas. I have been feeling weird kind of symptoms and I would like to have some help to get to know what is going on with me. My symptoms are bothering me and I would like to have some guidance on what to do and what they are. So basically about 2-3months ago I started having panick attacks. I was feeling anxious pretty much everyday. I was not happy with this pandemic, school and my friends. I was starting to feel down. Also, I would feel very anxious about my health. Every sensation in my body that was odd I would focus on it and react in a small stress. I would vegan to panick when I would get a panic attack even tho I knew it was that. I would still panic and wait. Also after my panic attacks I would feel weird odd symptoms the few following days. I would feel low on energy, chills and weird zaps in my head. Until one day, in may, I started being very irritated at everything and I would constantly get uncomfortable symptoms when I did daily activities like gym, go out with friends. I would feel very light sensitive, a tiny nausea some times and a lot of stress when I got odd symptoms. There would also be this feeling of fear and feeling down. Even tho I was with my girlfriend I constantly had this weird fear of living. I would think I would die any second when I would experience odd symptoms. Then In June it got worse. I was having anxiety symptoms and panic attacks almost everyday. I would say 5 time a week. I notice during the day I would get this sick feeling with all kinds of symptoms. Per exemple i would feel my body changing temperature, brain zaps, my heart beat felt irregular, I was getting very tired and feeling very drowsy. And then it escalated into a panic attack. But when it was in the evening I would feel completely normal and everything was fine. But I would start to think about why was I feeling that and trying to figure out what was going on with my brain and body. So I would worry and overthink. And the cycle would continue. Until one day the June 15, after having bad anxiety symptoms, I notice a numbness in my brain. Like I could not feel my emotions anymore. I was trying to feel happy, I know that I was happy, I was able to express it but I could not feel it. So I started panicking about that. As the days went by the panick attacks were slowly fading away, and when I was having one, I felt the physical sensations but my brain like did not care. I did not feel that adrenaline rush and that panic feeling. I cannot feel stress anymore. Its very hard to feel love, happy, satisfied. My pschyatrist prescribed me 25mg sertaline and said that that would help. I kept explaining her my symptoms and she was saying its all anxiety and seem like she did not care. I did a blood test, it came back fine. Right before I started the meditation, the numbness and my physical symptoms were very bad. I lost the feeling of hunger and fullness, the ability to feel tired, to feel heat, and to feel emotions. It felt like if my brain had a brick wall the seperates me from feeling my body. you can feel the empty feeling. Now I am on week 3 of sertaline and some symptoms calmed down. But I am still experiencing this numbness. I would wake up and feel like empty. I still get trouble feeling hunger and I get weird stools. I am still a bit worried on what is going on with my body. Can you help me re assure what I am having and teach me techniques to overcome this suffering please I would really appreciate it.

When I hint them what I want to do they just think I am seeking attention. I truly think they want the best for me, it is just that they are pushing me to the edge even more... I have always been a very rational person, and that is why this stresses me out even more, I cannot explain why these seemingly trivial things can lead me to this decision and why I kept sabotaging myself for years. It may sound cliche, but I do not want to die, it may be my survival instinct kicking in, I even still enjoy some things in life, but the pain its just unbearable, sometimes its stronger than any physical pain I have experienced before. I truly do not want to do it, because I feel extremely selfish and I fear that my mom would do it after me... I just hope that she can cope with the pain... After writting this I feel even worse, I am a piece of shit and there is no right way to fix it. I just do not want to hurt anyone except me.Its not my first attempt, there has been 2 before, both of them I ended up in the hospital, but the second time (15 years old) I ended up locked in the mental health unit. I just spent 1 day there, It was so terryfing that I avoided taking the medicine they gave me and escaped, yeah I know that sounds... Extrange, you may or may not believe it... But I did it, they called me from the hospital but I guess they did not want to involve in legal procedures. In summary, I do not truly talk to my psychiatrist about my real feelings, about my suicidal thoughts, for fear that I would end up there again. I do not want to listen empty phrases like \"all its going to be fine\" or \"this is just temporary\" I just do not want to keep suffering and I do not want to hurt anybody in the process. I am weak... I do not know what else to say, if you read it all sorry for making you lose time of your life doing it. Planned a date to do it", "class": "Suicidal"}

I had a salivary stone under my tongue a couple years ago causing my salivary glands to swell huge when I would eat. I guess its rare. I had it removed and since then I have some sort of nerve damage on the \"front\" of my neck. like my throat, but the outside and down to collar bone.So I had to leave my manual labor job and get a sit down security job. I started learning to program cuz my job is pointless and easy so I have free time.I moved back into my parents house. Nothing interests me anymore. Not even trying to turn anything around. I have friends but they are all succesful and own homes and are married having babies. So even when we hangout, although I am very happy for them, I inevitably drive back home, lonely, feeling like I have totally been left in the dust. Which is no ones fault, it just seems to be reality. gaming, music, movies, drawing- all things i used to love doing on my alone time- literally bore me to the point it makes me sad, so I do not even try anymore cuz it just makes me miss the old me. I love my family, but they are all very narcisistic(spelling). And my dad and mom both have health problems of their own. I really do not have anything to complain about compared to them, and they gave me a good childhood other than some abusive episodes. But they had very shitty childhoods.I just sit here and think about the past, the good days. Just , me being happy to be me. Fuck I am literally starting to tear up as I type this.I guess I am venting or asking if this is depression. I know I would need to be diagnosed by a doc. unfortunately I am broke and do not have insurance. sometimes I write this off as karma.

This made me lose most my relationships with people understandably, because its a obvious choice in who you want to defend you know. So I could not blame most of them, and there is not a single name to any of the other victims when I asked the people who where posting it.

{"id": "19208", "text": "Throwaway account cuz this is going to get a little personal. Ever since I was eight years old, I have felt extremely sad because of childhood trauma and not having friends. I somehow thought all of this shit would get better and that there would be a light at the end of the tunnel but it just did not happen. Within the last couple weeks, I have felt so lonely, helpless, and hopeless that I have wanted to self harm and slit my wrists open with an exacto knife or take my own life for good, but I cannot do it because there is a chance I might ruin my body instead of actually die. That, and my parents put me under so much pressure mentally that I cannot even feel completely suicidal and have to restrain my urges to self harm on a daily basis. I am tired of fighting this fight. I am tired of seeing everybody have happy memories while I have to fight through bad day after bad day. Instead of having long lasting romances and friends I can joke around with, and happy memories of being independent of my parents, I have to fight day after day just to survive. I have no fucking idea what happiness feels like. I just do not want to fight myself anymore. I just want my mind to go blank. I want a body to hold. I want memories. I want parents do not scream and criticize me all the time. I do not want to have to psych myself up to do things. I wish I did not feel suicidal but life has hit me with so much shit and I do not have the strength to take it. In fact, if I did not care so much about preserving other people's feelings, I probably would be dead by now. This shit never gets better. They always say it does but it does not. I just do not want to have to restrain myself anymore because I am scared I might snap and cut myself.

{"id": "15677", "text": "Ok so I never really used this place to rant. I had an horrible childhood that led me to become overly shy in public. Yes a man who can be socially insecure. I can already hear everyone running away. It seems like the worst thing for most people for some reason. It comes with lot of problems but I will cut right to the chase - I have so much trouble finding a woman that you would not even believe me if I told you the stories... I had so many opportunities of women coming to me, seducing me, doing the first steps and I messed most of them. The 2 times I tried doing the first steps it worked well but I chocked out and could not handle the pressure. Also I would give you examples but I doubt this place is NSFW even though people just openly discuss about death. I had something happened to me yesterday... pure torture seriously. it is like the devil or bad luck is playing with my soul. Anyways. I wish there was a way to find love easily for overly shy people. Whenever a cute girl comes to talk to me I just freeze and it is like I cannot find anything to think or say. They either think I am rude or not interested.. well that is what I presume at least. Sometimes I even ignored some of them even though I really wanted them. what is wrong with me? I tried seeing some doctors and shrinks about my shyness issues but it did not work. Now I live by myself and it sucks seeing everyone around me, every single person, is in couple or dating someone. And it seems so easy for them. I could try some dating app but I am too depressed to even try. Plus I feel they are lame. I do not know what to say. I am just in a real mess. It pisses me off you know? I do not know maybe I should stop caring. Maybe I should stop giving a shit and start drinking. I feel like I am trapped and I have been thinking about ending it recently. My life is simply not worth it. I am never drinking but tonight I might get drunk. being overly shy really sucks", "class": "Suicidal"}

I will not go into details about the specific act due to the fear someone might attempt to recreate it. Anyways, that would have been my second suicide attempt, the first one being about a year and a half ago with me stabbing myself in the neck a few times. Not the most elegant suicide method I admit but I was not looking for something elegant at the time. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) about 3 years ago, changed a few therapists and medications but nothing helped enough. It just feels like life has just been postponing suicide since my first attempt. On the bright side, I have not self-harmed since then but hell do I want to sometimes. In every bridge, every speeding car, every kitchen knife, every rope, every policeman even all I see is a way to death. The main question that people might have from the title - Did I go through with it? No. Why? I do not know really, instead, I went for a run (which is usually a temporary mood boost for me but it goes away quite quickly) and then I was too tired to do it. Do I still want to do it? Yes, yes and yes. I only stopped myself today too because a friend of mine has her birthday today and I do not want to ruin it even if we are not really close. it is just all postponing but I am not sure until when.

Then I would cry and hate myself because I felt like a failure that I could not complete it. Anyway, I guess I have always doubted the legitimacy of the things I say to myself or believe.

However, as my depression has gotten worse again, and I am likely experiencing an episode; maybe it is best that I can do a bit of venting. I am clinically diagnosed with chronic depression. I think it was a thing since I was 13 or so, when I experienced a trauma years before. But here is the vent, I guess:So I moved to a new county from my old home back a year or so ago. It was for college, and I have been living with my grandpa since. My dog is with me, and I care about her very much. Both my grandpa and my dog have been getting really old however, and I constantly worry for both their safety. My grandpa almost died to covid a couple months back and now he is unable to walk anymore, so I kind of just take care of him while I focus on my studies.While it is nice to take care of someone and being mindful of others wellbeing, I feel like I am missing the point of life. I am in my third year of college and I have practically changed majors multiple times (going for wanting to be a doctor, to accounting, to communications, and now I just want to draw art and talk to people), and I feel like I am just wasting my own money to \"figure out what I want to do.\" I keep trying to get myself to stick to hobbies and joining friend groups to play games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and MMOs like Phantasy Star Online 2; yet I still feel like I am a burden to my friends to hang out with.I really do not like bothering people, and I always feel like I am not doing the best I can. Whenever I go to family reunions, I am told that, \"I am not trying hard enough\" and \"All your problems will go away if you just do not think about it.\"I do not know what that even means. I get that they are trying to say that I should not be so focused on the fact that i feel like a stepping stone &amp; alone in this world. However, my mind thinks differently. I have been trying out their ideas. Smiling, keeping a positive attitude, being helpful when I can, doing everything I can in a pristine and mindful manner. But it feels like I am wearing a mask. I already wear a mask by trying to conceal my transgender identity. I do not know what to do.On the topic of transgender stuff and transitioning. it is difficult. I feel like I am living in an egg she will and it is so hard to get support without having the right financial insurance. Talking about dysphoria with my close friends &amp; relatives ends up in heated arguments where I am being delusional; telling me that, \"it is impossible to ever be a girl. You can never do it.\" Yet I have this hope that I can be a girl. I just, have no idea how to like, be a girl correctly since I know no one in this city who can help me.(TLDR) Either way, to wrap this up. I feel like I do not belong anywhere and I feel too afraid to reach out for help. I feel like I am not doing enough for my friends and family, as if I need to push myself even harder than what I can mentally do at this point.. I do not want to be a burden to anybody and I have been contemplating just giving up because of it. For anyone out there, do you have any advice or ideas for me to try out?

I have made an improvement that I have spent this year dieting and exercising, so I am making at least some improvement in my life and I have taken some pride in that.

I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs.

{"id": "14666", "text": "Life is not as bad as it could be. But here I am, drinking myself to drunkenness after being sober for over a month. Every day I think about the tasks I want to achieve, and slowly - painfully slowly - watch as the time moves forward with nothing done. Minutes to hours, hours to days, and I get not even a fraction done of what I wanted. Every night is a rebirth as I think of all the wonderful things I will do in the morning, every second into consciousness the next day a slow death as I fail. Fail to act. Fail to bother failing. I watch as years go by and the dreams I had when I was fresh out of college seem further and further away. they are always in the background, on the shelf. Waiting for me as the sense of urgency to make something of myself vanishes.I had a therapist. I could go back to her. She was nice. Kind. She cried once, as I was telling a story of my life - and that split second of humanity meant the world to me. My pain was validated - if I could bring her to tears, maybe the trauma I had gone through was actually fucked up? Maybe I could not feel quite as guilty for pushing so many people away, for crippling my own success, for never giving myself a break? For being so miserable? For being weak?But just like the rest of my life, that moment has long since died. I have no excuses anymore. I will die a failure. Forgotten. Because I have two jobs and no time for therapy....... but really, I just do not want to acknowledge these faults. I thought I was done with this illness.The alcohol is hitting harder since it is been so long. it is been so long since I have been able to acknowledge this despair...And I am sabotaging myself again. A new love has entered my life. Yet I feel so numb to them. They do not deserve it. But I do not know what a healthy relationship is. I could not even fake it if I wanted to. They were so excited when they first met me. They messaged me all throughout the day, messaging me multiple times even if I did not respond. I am sorry, Casey. you are a good person. you are so sweet. I wish I knew how to love you.I want this to end.

{"id": "7171", "text": "Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (26 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!", "class": "Depression"}

Got a whole lot better, like I stopped having panic attacks, no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror, no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest, and then I decided it was time for to continue uni, and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me, the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100% online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an \"outsider\" and \"temporary\", yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning, I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student, and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience, and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower, before I sleep, and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed, make so little progress for work, and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 1/10 of our minimum wage, and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online, so its basically unpaid internship.

{"id": "17431", "text": "Last week, I made a passive choice to stop fighting. This is not my first time here but, I think this is really going to be it for me. These are my reasons why:1. Nobody would miss meMy family moved out of the country (parents+siblings) and are now permanent residents of another country that I do not have access to (plane ticket prices + covid restrictions + I am a foreigner so I cannot ever just live with them). Its funny, they did not even tell me they were moving until they got their passports renewed two months before. I was just in college and they left me here by myself. So yes, I think I have good reason to believe that my death would not impact the day-to-day life of my immediate family. My old friends and I barely talk. I do not have a job or coworkers. I live with my ex and as soon as I move out, we will be going no contact. So there, nobody would legitimately miss me in any way that is actually meaningful. In fact, I could bet you that I could go a month being dead somewhere and nobody would notice. 2. I am not important. Like I said, I do not have a job. I do not have friends. I do not have a partner. I do not have anything going on in my life. I do not even have pets who depend on me. If anything, because I cannot find work, I can only assume that my skills and education are useless in the current market. I have nothing to offer anybody. 3. I do not want to be here. Id say this is the least important one but if it still matters. If all of the above is true, then what reason do I have to be here if I do not want to be? I have no prospects. My future looks bleak. Id rather control my death if I cannot even control my life. So there. These are my justifications. After I leave this apartment, and my ex no longer expects to hear from me, I will find a peaceful place, away from everybody and say goodbye to this world. I cannot say that its been good but I really did my best. I tried very hard for a long time. I just think that I have nothing to offer to anybody or anything. The world will be no different with or without me. I am posting this because I do not think its fair to tell this to anybody irl. I want a quiet exit but I also just want to explain myself.

Except as of lately I am going back to old habits I finally stopped during that time. I become a bitch to everyone, I have attitude for no reason. No but the worst part is the worthlessness I feel. From age 11-22 I do not think I have ever not had suicidal thoughts. Well in May-July I really was so high on spirituality and accepting the world around me. I honestly did not have bad thoughts come in to my head. But as of this week I am back to the same shit. I cannot get the imagine of cutting out of my head. Or other methods (I have always imaged a rope or g*n but know I would not use one method and I could never buy the other). And at this point it does not feel depressing it feels annoying. Like my depression is taunting me like hey do not you still want to do this. And the answer is yes. I have derealization issues, I have self worth issues. I have a hard time accepting I am alive and its just a lot to deal with. Before May when I had these thoughts I believed them. I still believe them but this time I know its more a mental illness and not my souls desire if that makes sense. Like a heart attack is the hearts issue but the heart did not do it on purpose its just an inconvenience. I do not know if that makes any sense but basically I do not want to be a human anymore I do not want to daydream violent things, while also struggling to accept I live in reality while also trying to be hopeful its all too much Becoming self aware", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "17027", "text": "When I was barely over the age of one, cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say, I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child, eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though, I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child, which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption, sadly though, the parents who had adopted me, had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids, while occasionally we would see our dad. Though, my mother would rarely let me see my father. It was obvious from the start, I was different from other kids. I look back on it, and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment, I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help, my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD, but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love, would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get, she would not allow me inside, and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside. Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex, and my father who was extremely strict, grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person, and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more, I went back and forth between my mom and dad, eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression, but as soon as I became an adult, I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family, who I have Always had a rocky relationship with, and was always shut down and told to stick it up. They ignored my pain and suffering, and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back, she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else, and like an idiot, I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt, and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired, and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this, I just want to be set free from this misery. I also cannot help but resent my father, he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. He says to work hard, even if it means work 24/7, since he is an alcoholic. But I just struggle so much, and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff, but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much, who finally admitted to him that I have been suicidal.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child, has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment, but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism, I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore, and I guess really, I just want to be heard.

{"id": "19253", "text": "For the longest time I have been very very depressed. my Depression started when I was probably in elementary school. I was sent to the counselor's office because I looked sad or I was acting sad or I was not participating in class because I was so overwhelmed with my emotions. My father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. My mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003. She sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that I was gay. She also kicked me out of the house at 17. I ended up leasing a cheap SRO studio in Chicago so I could have a roof over my head. I paid for that rent with my job at Best Buy. I still do not know how I did it, but I didFast forward to 2015. I went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 I started doing heroin occasionally\\[and now I do it almost every day -- its been like this since September 2020\\]Despite all of this, I was still dating because I thought that finding a partner would fix everything.I met the person who I thought would be my partner for life in 2018. Even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year I still kept coming back. I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end. Ill never see these people again, right?I am quite sure that I am going to be done with all of this by the end of July. I cannot take life anymore. Humans are horrible.tl;dr: I am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. I am also an addict.

{"id": "16556", "text": "Hey guys,I have been depressed most my adult life but these past few years have been really bad. Back in 2016 I developed this headache and neck pain that to this day pretty much runs my whole life. I have had a headache of just about every minute of every day since one specific day in 2016. No doctor has ever been able to figure out. So I am forced to just live in pain and basically act like its not there if I want to try and do much of anything. I had dreams and goals since I was in HS. I wanted to be a P.H.d molecular biologist doing some sort of academic research or work in industry. I worked really hard and got into the best uni in my state, got a full ride, and during college did fairly well with a lot of new aspirations developing. I was depressed on and off during this time. Usually having to do with girls or test grades or finances. Stuff that you can deal with. But all in all i had a lot of friends and would say I was generally a happy person.Then the headache hit. I always thought it would just go away one day but as the months grew I started to isolate and become incredibly depressed. I got through school but it was so ugly. Had to use substances just so that I could even study molecular biology. At this point I was starting to get really upset with everything. Often I would get upset with my friends and peers because they did not have to deal with this. I would get invited to stuff but honestly nothing is fun anymore, especially social situations. I moved across the country after college to get a job and hopefully start fresh. But nothing changed. At this point I am basically certain this medical condition and the depression are here to stay forever. Imagine having a good child hood, got everything we needed, great education growing up, no child trauma at all, get a full ride for the school/degree you have been wanting for years and graduate. Only to realize that nothing you accomplish will make you happy. It hurts more than the headache itself lately. My soul is wounded and I have completely lost hope. I have been on and off meds for a few years and none of them help.And the thing that makes me suicidial is when my friends and family act like I am doing great because I have a fancy job a nice car and my own place. I have told them how I experience the world and some of them just do not believe it and attack my character. I feel like a lost sheep alienated from the world. I am basically jealous of every single person I interact with. Lately I will be walking around near my apartment and I will seriously get jealous of homeless people.

Life is pretty cool, I guess.\"Yeah. Never felt that way and probably never will.Some will call me lazy or a loser, but from my perspective, life is not worth the effort.

Not my parents, family members, past friends, etc. They always get so mad but I do not have it within me to fucking say that shit. it is so far beyond my functioning that I feel fake as fuck saying it.But then other times, I question if I really do not love my parents.

I watch behind my computer screen as people go about their lives, making accomplishments and being social, while I just stay in my room and plot my useless ideas. Mostly I just want it to end. Except I have no way to kill myself and every time I have tried has not worked out? I feel most days that the cosmos is taunting me for something I did wrong, and cannot figure out how to make things better. Pain follows pain. In all, I know that I have no way out except death.Most people think that they know loneliness, but nobody knows it better than me. I have very few friends, most of all people view me as an oddity who they do not want to spend time with. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend and I am basically never going to because I am both autistic and asexual. The solitary life might not be so bad if I did not have this craving for human contact that I have had for years (I am now 22). All I long for is to go out with people but I have no way of meeting them. I was bullied in high school and had to drop out. At university, I could not seem to make any because I was too depressed by various things. Covid did not help. And so I have gotten to a stage where I feel like a complete outsider in society, hating myself and divorced from the norms of everyone else. I have very obscure interests, philosophy and literature, and art and movies. On top of that, I do not have any career both because I find it sustain one and my autism.I am an artist, except what good is that if nobody cares about my art? I have made albums of music that nobody really listened to and I was too depressed to advertise. I have also just finished a novel that nobody is going to read. I thought for the past few years that I could express the unique aspects of how I view the world through art, but I do not think it matters. Nobody is interested in me. I could self-publish my book and then nobody will read it. And so I feel constantly invisible, like a ghost that walks through people embedded in the world. I have been forgotten; I do not belong here; I am just a strange cosmic absurdity.And so what are my options in life, go on every day in perpetual misery and loneliness having had many years of proof that nothing gets better?

Imagine having to life the rest of your life in a state even worse then now. Say you survive, would you know better to finish the job, or would you just suffer?Everything has gone downhill since that year. I had a large group of friends that year who all cared for one another. We looked after each other. We had similar interested. It was fantastic! I had a phenomenal teacher that year. Our class was so close. You could chat with anybody. It felt like a miniature family. My family did not fight every day back then. There was an influx of video games to play. Content I enjoyed (both television and YouTube) was at a peak. I actually enjoyed playing Basketball.I had motivation to get out of bed. Lastly, have not been in a relationship since 2017/2018. Have no interest in it. The worst part about all of this is that I did not cherish it as much in the moment compared to now. How was I supposed to know it just got worse?

I know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff, if I did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife, I would be gone in a flash. Well I guess I am slowly killing myself by smoking, so maybe I should stop that. Not that I want to, but I do not want some higher power being like \"hmm, you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you? Okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place MWHAHAHAHA\" Not calling it God, the abrahamic deity called God is so fucking childish, if there was really a creator or high power of some sort, it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him, getting angry and jealous, and having three different forms yet saying they are all one. Maybe there is no creator or higher power and the pre-existent bigbang has always existed. I do not know dudes, but I am sick of living, but I do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push \"me\" into an even worse place(or I do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that) I feel like I am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already. we are already in hell dudes, is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within, I have no idea, but I guess I will try again. Maybe some meditation or something will help me, this world so fucked up yo. How could I possibly know I have not been existent an infinite amount of times? Can you try to think back to what you/it were like before you were born? You cannot, or at least I cannot. Maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur, but there are theories for infinite universes so I do not know. If the universe is possible, then I guess anything is possible. Maybe I am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me, or maybe I am part of that illusion as well. who is fucking dream is this world? Or is this dream/illusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it. An illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk.

{"id": "12305", "text": "Several months ago I went through a terrible breakup of a 4-1/2 year relationship. I lost the person that knew more about me than anyone - including my parents. I had to move back in with them, and it was rough. For a few months we tried taking a \"break,\" where I was not allowed to contact her unless it was something we both planned. Right off the bat, she told me that she just wanted to break up but was also curious to see where things went.&amp;#x200B;After two months of listening to all of the fun she was having without me, and her starting to find excuses to back out of everything, I decided it was time to end it. Regretfully it was over the phone, but I do not know if I had a choice because she would agree to meet and back out at the last minute.&amp;#x200B;I was suicidal for a long time after that. Like not eating for several days at a time, looking for any websites with information about how to commit suicide, and even going places to get supplies. I lost about 20 lbs in just over a month because of this. I constantly reminded myself of everything that my ex told me was wrong with me and every mistake I made in the relationship. This was the person who knew me the best, and they thought so terribly of me, so I took it to mean that was who I am.&amp;#x200B;I started going on long, aimless drive to get out and try to find something. Several times I ended up in the city my ex and I had lived in. Our lease did not end for another month, so I stopped by the apartment once after she said she had moved. My head was thinking of all the good memories I had with her there and told me to go, so I did. But actually being there was completely different. She still had random items all over the apartment, and she still had a few of her collages there, but all of my pictures were removed. A letter that I wrote to her shortly after the breakup was laying in a pile of junk mail on the couch.&amp;#x200B;After seeing all of this, I made my first suicide attempt. I tried hanging myself, but I stopped because that shit's uncomfortable. I tried calling a few friends, but they were busy and could not talk. I did not know what to do, so I just drove back to my parent's and locked myself in my room.&amp;#x200B;I decided I might as well do everything that I can to find something in life, so I started traveling. I did a family vacation that went terribly because everything's uncomfortable around my parents now. I visited a few friends, and that was a really good time. I honestly felt great for the first time in a long while.&amp;#x200B;After about a month of that, I found a new apartment in the city where my ex and I lived because I am still going to school there. It was really difficult at first to be here and see all of the places we would go just a few months ago, but that slowly wore off and now it is just mildly difficult. First week I am here, I see my ex pulling into the same parking lot that I am leaving. I decide to go visit a friend to get out of town, and end up running into her mom. Then, two weeks later, I saw her going out with the guy that she said was just a school friend.&amp;#x200B;I was feeling great and not thinking much about suicide, but now it is starting to come back. I have thought about it almost everyday this week. I think about jumping into traffic when I am on a walk, driving my car into the river on my way home, giving myself alcohol poisoning, or just starving myself. But I just do not know anymore. I feel like I have this drive to just keep going and meet someone else and live a dream life, but at the same time I know I am not hard working, smart, or wealthy enough to get any of those dreams. I feel like it would create too much drama, too.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading this. I am sorry for how long and rambling it is; I just needed to vent.

I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything.

Go out get food, to bring back to my room, and eat it cold. Makes sense actually. Fits my life.So close, but never quite there.

( No ones about my reddit account).I hate social media. All I see are a bunch of stupid posts. Post that think are funny to those people but they are obviously not to me. I get annoyed at everything. I hate small talk, so when someone, whether it is a random person or someone I know, say some stupid shit like \"hey\" or \"how are you\" I just want to throw my fucking phone out the window. I hate it. I hate talking to people. I was not always like this. I never really had friends (a bff, reliable, etc) in my life so I would be kind of open to try and make new friends, but everytime, something about it just makes not want to hang out with them or talk to, and it is not the introverted side talking, it is the annoyance of that person. Just when you think someone is okay, first impression, over a short period of time, I realize that these people are just not my type to talk to, hang out with, etc. I ghost them because I do not want to talk to, what I think are \"pathetic\" people. I have never told anyone about this kind of hatred except for here, so in their perspective, I am a \"chill\" person. I keep everything bottled up. EVERYTHING including grudges that I could remember since the day I learned to walk. No ones cares about me, no one pays attention to me. So out of the blue and without any thought, I am just logging out of my social media, hiding and deleting content. I hate looking and my class graduates having the time of their life. I hate how when I try to explain something to them, they do not get it or get the actual point of it.All I see is a bunch of stupid people. I know if these see what I typed here, they would think less of me. They already think I am a nobody. I was a nobody in high and I am a nobody now. I hate when people say \"If you need someone to talk to I am right here\" because that is what EVERYONE says. When i do manage to talk to someone, it is just stupid advise, stupid talk, surely they do not understand how I am feeling and what I am going through because they say some shit that does not even relate to it. there is not even a point in get some kind of \"therapy\" talking to someone because I think I am too stubborn to listen to so-called \"advice.\"I have always been the quiet person, in school, at home, everywhere. So this post just seems more like a rant than a cry for help. It might be just the symptoms from the withdrawals I had from my antidepressants. I take 75mg of venlafaxine, and my pharmacy fucked up my prescription order so I have been off of them for a good few weeks. I finally got back on them about yesterday. it will take some time for me to calm down now, but when I am on this current medication, I still feel aggravated.My first meds were 10mg of Lexapro, then 20mg lex., then 10mg of Prozac, 37.5mg Effexor XR, now 75mg of Effexor.I am for this post. I am sorry for this stupid rant. Surely I am going to regret this later and feel embarrassed, but I just do not let anything out. I bottle up too much shit. it is hard to talk about stupid feelings and such. Ghosting my social media seems like a great start for me, I have hated it for many reasons.Sorry again. I am 21F.

Not counting those in, when I tried to actually befriend girls. Well, that is the only thing I have been trying to do for the last couple of months. I see all my friends with their girlfriends, and it makes me frustrated. Not the thing that I cannot get a girlfriend, the thing that I cannot get a friend who is a girl. I cannot get a girl to talk to me.I get absolutely zero attention from girls. I have thought that it is because of my looks - \"maybe I am ugly\" - but several people told me that I am above average looking, I am also not fat, not skinny, but kind of muscular (I do work out).I do not seek validation from other people, I get enough. I am a 3D modeler and a video editor, and my friends praise me all the time when I make something new. I seek female attention, but do not get any. It makes me depressed and frustrated, I cannot get my work done because of it, makes me unmotivated and sad. I rarely go out these days because of the fear of rejection. Whenever I try to focus on my projects, I get reminded of these things every time. How do I not concentrate on girls? Or what should I do? Being unmotivated because of no female attention.

Basically, I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background, I still live at home with parents, I have a fairly decent job, a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad, travelled the south east, been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of, working a job they hate Monday - Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat (myself included). I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house/ engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way, like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year, an ok wage, food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community, travel, adventure, good relationships, passion, excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 9-5 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat!

{"id": "19710", "text": "I am 25 years old. I have struggled with social anxiety, depression, disordered eating and gender dysphoria since I was 13. Twelve years of suffering. This past year-and-a-half the pandemic came along, of course, and destroyed any improvements I might have made prior to it (even if some of those were admittedly a bit of a facade, me convincing myself and others I would improved because \"I am doing this good thing now and I am not doing that bad thing anymore\"). The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways; I feel like it is effects for me have been multiple and some of then I am feeling far more now (at the \"end\" of lockdown) than I ever did during the height of lockdown.there is the enforced isolation, which has increased my social anxiety tenfold, to the point where the loosening of restrictions only means I am isolating even more because there is too many people outside and I cannot cope with them seeing me, looking at me, interacting with me, forming an opinion of me - even a split-second, meaningless judgement is terrifying. I know it is irrational, but social anxiety has this way of making the irrational fears so loud and intrusive that they can become self-fulfilling. I can rationally say to myself, \"nobody cares, nobody's looking at you\". Then I take a 5 minute walk to the shop and have a panic attack due to being so overwhelmed with anxiety. Well now everyone is looking at you, because you are staggering around hyperventilating clutching your chest like you are having a heart attack, you dumb shit. Then there is all the time spent alone with my own thoughts, ruminating over every little thing I have ever said and done, punishing myself and berating myself for things I said without thinking back in \"normal\" times when face-to-face social interaction was a daily occurrence so I let my guard and filter down. I do not just mean cringey moments (although I have plenty of those too), but cruel or thoughtless comments and actions which honestly just make me a terrible human being. Then there is the doomscrolling. Literally, on news websites etc. but also figuratively, in my own mind, which was arguably the master of spiralling into negative and pessimistic thoughts about the world long before \"doomscrolling\" was even a term. Thinking about how we got here and where we are headed and how fucked up the world is. Overpopulation and overconsumption and human selfishness and speciesism mean future pandemics and local and global travesties are only going to get more common. This is not the \"end\", it is just the beginning. Climate change is always on my mind, to some degree. I feel helpless and hopeless, I do not believe humanity will change enough or in time to save this planet. I do the things I can, but I am painfully aware I could be doing more and be more of an activist if I was less depressed and self-pitying. I am also painfully aware that I could do everything in my power and it would not scratch the surface, so long as huge money-obsessed corporations continue to because more destruction in a day than I could in a year, even if I did not bother to try at all. My gender dysphoria is worse because I was forced to sit with my thoughts and acknowledge it for what it really is and always has been. Denial is not healthy, but it sure feels better sometimes than admitting an uncomfortable truth to yourself. And once you admit that truth? You have to fight tooth and nail to get the things required to finally feel comfortable in your own damn skin. I am lucky that coming out was relatively safe and painless for me in terms of others' reactions, and I am so grateful for that. But boy is it a lot of work having to repeatedly \"prove\" your identity to strangers, while constantly second-guessing it yourself (hello, imposter syndrome), only to be told everything is a 3 year wait and costs thousands. Fill out this form and take this test and pay for this consultation and even then you are not our ideal candidate, so we will get back to you. it is exhausting and I have so little fight left in me. Giving up means giving up any possibility that I will ever be happy but sometimes I still want to, just because I am tired of it. That last sentence was about my gender dysphoria, sure, but it is also how I feel about life as a whole. Suicide is giving up. A dead person cannot be happy, but they cannot be miserable either. I am also in physical pain that I cannot get looked at by a medical professional because the doctors need photo ID to update my name, which I do not have. My back and knees are a steady 3/10 when busy or distracted. 7/10 when I try to sleep, unless I am blackout drunk. 9/10 if I smoke weed, for some reason. Everyone talks about weed helping with pain, but if I smoke I am damn near calling myself an ambulance just to get high-strength painkillers because my back hurts so much. I feel fairly sure the physical pain is related to a sedentary lifestyle. I sit at work all day, then I sit and watch TV or go to bed early, I do not exercise because I am scared to go outside and besides I have no motivation. It cannot be good for me and I think my body is trying to tell me that. Every time I try to end a post like this I think of something else, another reason I feel so suicidal. Maybe I should focus on the positives? I am young, maybe not in tip-top physical condition but probably fixable to a decent standard of health/comfort with the right treatment and effort. I live in a wealthy country with access to everything I could ever need. I have a job, I am financially independent, I can make rent and pay for food and even luxuries. I have a family who love me (especially my mum, who means everything to me). I could probably be fairly attractive if I worked out and took better care of myself. I am not unintelligent and I have some compassion, so I could probably do things to help people and better the world if I put more effort in. All of these positives just fill me with so much guilt. I do not deserve these benefits or opportunities, they are wasted on me. Focusing on the positives makes me wish someone else could take my place and be in my position and make full use of it, so I could just be dead. I just want to kill myself.

{"id": "19775", "text": "First of all, why do we live? For like having a good time? I do not think that is the point. All the evolution which made today's circumstances does not look like to point it. It is so obvious for me after spending my whole life just thinking about stuff, it is all about picking side. Sides of this war between life and death are pretty obvious, yet so hard to see. Either you choose life and fight with the problems that other side put in your life or accept the loose and side with them. Everyone I know think that they are in the life's side. Little they know, it is been so long that they bowed their head to death. Everyone is painting the truth with their lies along with their desires. They just do not want to loose to death so they let the scummers do their job. The world built by human is literally built for the people have power to keep and raise it. Majority of others is ok with it because their only hope is to be in or getting close to those positions. Than what? What would they do if they reach to thier dreams? Sadly, same... They are just fillers who accetped their exintance in that way. No different than any material in the world. Even their behaviour has no freedom to choose other. It is like we all at a cliff and all we can think about is to use others to make us a safe zone. Why we do that if there is an obvious cliff that screams \"nothing\" from below. We all serve to nothingness while we think \"we are doing our best\" to aviod it. So I want to ask again, why do we live? If I will face with nothingness, what does matter about what I do in my life time? What makes something right or wrong? Adding values on it? Because no matter how you live deeply your life, every value made by us destroyed same way. But before that I have to explain what I mean by fight between life and death. Life comes from nothing, and makes something. Death comes from something, and makes nothing. When life try to find ways for not being reachable for death, death tries to find a way to stop life's movement. Like a heart rate, it kept the universe this way to us today. Every decisions we make comes from one of them. It is so heartbroken to see everyone choosing death's side. Because creating is hard work, if you going to do hard work it is better to do what is obvious and served, so everyone falls to the net of the death which is hanging on the cliff. They think it is safe and they covered, but little they know its all part of the plan to ending our existince. I am not delusional neither consiparcy person, it is what is going to happen in the long run as far it seems ... What is a valueable? Is it money? Is it water? Obviusly, whatever we need has a value. The value can change along with the circumstances. For example, life. Life is most valuable thing we have right? I guess not. Because it is only valuable if it means something to someone else. Otherwise, no one cares. It can be person who loves you or can be person who wants to use you. Rather than those, it only has value for you, if you think it is valuable. So here is the question, does your life valuable for you? It is simply a potential source. You could use it to have things, but that is just a possibility. Most of the time people pass before they satisfied with their gains in exchange with their life's. This is why most of the people who wants to suicide because they do not want to be other side of the fight neither to see that they are loosing. I am having the same problem, why do I live if I am going to end up with nothingness with all those pain, only gain is here to have less pain? It is pretty logical to me, but really hard to decide. What is the real problem than? Is it everyone choosing the winning side or is it that there is no hope for the other side? This makes me depressed because I am pretty sure that nothing could beat an honest mind. If the life is able to come from nothingness, than nothing can defeat it. Death is just there to us for improvement, not to make us giving up. We could colonize whole universe and that could be just a freaking beggining. We could choose to be anything yet we choose to be worst. I have no power to change it all, I wish I could live my life by chasing my dreams. Sadly it is not allowed and I am exhausted. I had so much energy, so much willpower but they all been sucked by monsters to place me next to other billions of lost existances. Hope you find a way to fight with it, it seems I will not be able to hold on in close future. I have questions", "class": "Suicidal"}

Suicidal and self-harm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful.

I do not think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just do not trust myself to take care of me, yk?A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty do not know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. I am not saying I am going to kms but I am just scared for my well-being.I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I do not want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option.

I was really really happy, but 2 months after, she left me for no reason. And this is the beginning of my depression. During the first months, I have never gone outside my house, I have tried killing myself twice. I was totally depressed, I did not want to live anymore. A part of me has disappeared, and I have not found it yet. After 18 months, I feel better, but something is not the same since. I have no more self confidence. The self confidence I gained during my relationship disappears 2 months later. Now I am sure people cannot like me. But here is the problem. I really like a girl, but I know she is way out of my league. And I think she will reject me so I do not try anything. I do not know how. So I think I will be lonely forever, because I am too afraid.

I had to tell her to leave last night but she would not leave I was crying hysterically my bedroom because I am trying to leave and abusive government housing situation.And she did not say a word even though she heard me and I just felt so unloved and uncared forI started just losing it and saying like go back to your perfect life then because I have to live in this awful while everyone else seems to be doing relatively okay and I mentioned my dad raping me which she denied but when I first told her she did not deny it and she confirmed but now she says I am crazy and then it never happened and I have a disorder.I always internally feel like this mentally psycho messed up ungrateful person.

I cannot separate my business from who I am it is very important that I spread awareness about social issues as well as what I went through being trafficked. I am on assistance and I am scared they will cut me off because I have not reported my earnings because if I do that they will cut my check for the next month and since I do not make consistent income it is not a good idea for me but in the end I lose anyways.My building is government they treat you like garbage they take your full amount of rent you get from the government and leave you in an apartment that is a death trap in a fire hazard no matter what you do or you call no one gives a s***.I actually really do love myself and care about myself and there is a lot of things that I love in life but it is getting to the point where how can I survive when I do not even have a decent support network and it is hard for me to even get out of bed. I tried to have my mom help me and clean but obviously the emotions are too untangled there and the way she treats me when she comes as if as if I am a huge burden and I cannot do it myself and she just snaps at me and I feel so trapped. This place is giving me money to move but they are not helping me whatsoever I have never lived in apartment by myself that has not been government I have no idea what they want and they have just basically said we have money in your lucky to have it you are ahead of the edge but they kind of just throw me to the Wolves I am indigenous/white as well and the funding is linked through indigenous funding so as well as you know assistant so I am scared I will end up in a worse place than I am already in. I thought I would be able to stay at this building in particular for a little bit longer since it had mental health case supports a doctor's office in it things like that but the support staff here are condescending rude recap privilege look down upon you talk over you hang the phone up on you if you do not behave and you do not cooperate you are treated like a client in a mental in a mental institution and treated like you do not know anything you are not smart you are a degenerate and no requests you have for your disabilities are met with any type of meaningful conversation just stonewalling even if you go to your doctor get a note or the Human Rights association like I'mlosing a battle hereAnyways I live everyday and anxiety my heart pounding I live in terror that these people are going to hurt me because I am speaking out about the abuse and I am just scared they are going to hurt me anyways because the last maintenance man was sexually assaulting the tenants here and he got fired but there is two other maintenance men that are just as bad so I put a double lock on my door and I have a knife beside me at nightThis is no way to live and no one understands how hard it is to find a place as one person by yourself and not get scammed and make sure it is okay and it is safe and that I do not end up on the streets again. I do not understand like everyone around me just lacks empathy and any type of emotional intelligence they do not listen to what I want they do not listen to what type of apartment I want and I just want to give up like I am just overwhelmed and these people want too much from me and then they get almost mad because I cannot do it but then they send me listings that are completely what I told them not and I am just feeling disrespected at this point and I tell them but nothing changesI feel like nothing changes ever no matter what I do I am just exhausting myself on a f****** hamster wheel no one can help me no one ever does I do not deserve this.I do not see any light at the end of the tunnel I do not have one person in my life that has my best interest in mind.I do not really want to die but I do not want to live like this and I do not want it to get worse.

{"id": "11543", "text": "I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself.

{"id": "8081", "text": "This is a long post and is all over the place. I have to rant as I cannot ever physically say my emotions or feelings and therefore cannot tell my own therapist about this or anyone really. I have been suicidal since I was at least 13. There are notes as far back as 9 saying I might as well die to my doctors. My home life was never good.I have always said Ill die by 40 if I make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better. My guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older. I have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me (probably my fault since I get irritable). For reference, I am autistic (aspergers), have ADHD, anxiety and depression. The latter three since I was 6 years old. My little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner (leftovers, she knows I do not eat regular meals. I forget or food just is not appealing.. I am very picky and she knows me by now). Pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today, but its making me cry more that she even noticed. Maybe she did not notice but I know she caught on as I was crying as she brought me food. I know I have my own issues, but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and I just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family. My older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways. But I am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and I cannot be perfect. I have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when I was 15 when my mom got married (which I would not ever trade it was a good thing). I got my act together but instead just have the same issues I did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all. I have not dated. Never been asked out. I lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things. People say I am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial. No one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something. I realized I am starting to suffer severe burn out. Doctors notes say at age 13 I said Ill stay in my room and just not talk. I have done that since and did not even know I saw that. My memory itself it very poor. But here is the catch. How do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions? I always lie on impulse and say I am watching a sad movie (which is what I did today and I referenced a movie I cried to recently called Ride Your Wave). I do not think I can be vulnerable. Therapy and medicine has not helped this because I am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum. I either lie or get so angry if I have to express the truth, so I never express the truth. The anger is really me just being overwhelmed and I know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it. I was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits. To be fair, I hit too. My parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child. My mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once (they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointments).How can I be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when I struggled the most and it came off as anger? I got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since I got good grades. My own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how I am or how I feel. I just answer I am fine. Its stifling. I never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how I am or press further? It hurts. Sometimes I hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope. I am not completely hopeless, but 10 (25) years of working my ass off to feel like I have not gotten anywhere socially and I still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room. People say to just try/do it. I try it and fail I get overwhelmed and cannot do it again. I am trying hard and they know I am behind but it seems I can only help myself but I just have not been able to. I know at this point I need to do things alone but how do I start? Not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until October. Online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant I take. I am just stuck. Thanks for reading. I am just not sure Ill be here when I am middle age if I do not progress or even a year. Being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but I cannot help it. Why cannot people be more understanding. Why cannot I understand myself.

{"id": "10435", "text": "Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow, thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world", "class": "Suicidal"}

I am not like that now but I find myself.... Slipping into the old meI was on a walk with my roommates about 2 days ago and I was just talking about science because I thought it was cool, but I guess for some reason she was telling me that it is not true and that it is a theory and stuff. I do not want to call her stupid or anything, but she has a disorder where her mental age is that of a kid. So she likes to act smart even if there is proof that it is right and she is wrong. it is her own thing I guess.But anyway I... Slipped into my old self.... I started being a dick and going out of my way to prove her wrong... And it... eventually hit me... And I have not talked much in two daysFriday morning (I think) I was up early (1:00ish) and I went to a bridge... I stood there for about 30 minutes... thoughts rushing though my head. Then I went home at like 3:00 since I have not been able to sleep. So I decided to wake my roommates (her and her boyfriend) and I opened up... And that is something I never did. I told them everything that was going on, about who I used to be... And the part that echos through my head... Is when she said something and the way my mind saw it was like... Kind of pitty in a way... And I got furious... I grabbed my shoes and I threw them against the wall. Then I stopped myself...I eventually went back to sleep... And I ended up crying a good portion of the day. I think my roommates thought I was asleep because they never checked on me. I eventually did fall asleep. Then I woke up around 8:00 and I went to find them. Maybe they were doing something. They were outside walking around playing Pokemon Go.I walked with them and I made some comments that... Old me would say... So I shut up... That was around 11:00 and it is now 3:00 for me... And I keep having that rushing thoughtIf I kill myself who would care? I feel like I do not want to live with guilt and PTSD for things I have done... I keep thinking... I have a plan and stuff to... I... do not know what is stopping me.... that is the odd part... I do not have biological parents I know, I only have adopted parents, who do not really care. My mom says \"if you kill yourself, we will be sad but we will not be broken\" and that hurtsI've eventually come to the conclusion that I do not like my roommate because she reminds me of a lot of things that...

For the past 3 years, it has caused me to struggle with anhedonia more regularly and it has been getting worse lately. I am in my mid-twenties and I already feel like I have missed out on so many experiences and opportunities in life, especially those that are fun. A lot of people have said I am too serious and I need to learn how to loosen up and let go. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to do that with alcohol or drugs. I am nervous that I might start increasing start relying on them to feel alive and have let loose. Recently, I started going to therapy and I have been wanting to go out and try something fun, but due to anhedonia, it is difficult for me to find something that is fun for me to do. I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either. My parents were helicopter-y and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okay/fun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame.

However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to \"live\" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me.

Also sorry if this is not the right subreddit.&amp;#x200B;To start, I had a pretty good upbringing and almost no problems at all. I went through school without much trouble. My parents were good to me. Really, nothing to complain about. But, I just do not feel joy in anything at all, hobby's I had just feel so mundane like everything else. I quickly get annoyed or just drained when I am able to hangout with friends. When I am alone for too long, my thoughts just get so deep and sometimes get suicidal. This has been going on for sometime.Despite Covid-19 rampaging around, I could find a somewhat decent paying job. I drowned myself in work, just so I could not think at all. My colleague and now somewhat close friend was worried about me working too much, but to be honest I do not mind it. That was until she made it clear I was really just living to work the past year. I recently made a promotion to a supervising position, but frankly, it does not do much to me. it is not that I miss my old work that much, but it just does not trigger anything inside of me. If anything, I am sort of left with a bittersweet feeling. This is just me in a nutshell. A 22 year old who had a normal upbringing who for some reason has no joy in life or a goal at all.

{"id": "9892", "text": "First off, I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18, I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance ($250 fee) and then to the hospital (got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance) and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd (July 2nd) I was on a multi-day alcohol bender and attempted (pills). Cops showed up and I was not compliant (kept telling them to leave me alone) and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying \"you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs\". They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said \"you just touched my dick again\" and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said \"because you told us to fuck off like 20 times\" and \"we are doing what is your best interest\". Riiight, not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100% illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT, and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail, I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it, shit food, a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors, social workers are there but rarely see you (saw mine on the 5th day, was supposed to be every day), and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 5-10 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure \"well, just let us know if you have a seizure\" and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on, or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said \"you are not going through withdrawals, it is a benzodiazepine, it is the same thing\". I was crying, I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo W/Ds feel, you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm, my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing (felt like my back and neck were about to snap) was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said \"if you flop on the floor like that, I am not going to give you any benzos\".The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward, it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile, a violent methhead, a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day, a couple fucking, violence between patients and security/police, emergency calls, etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor (because my psych forgot to see me one morning) and he was more or less like \"what the fuck are they doing?\". I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words, but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys, be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward, even voluntarily", "class": "Depression"}

All throughout my life, I feel like I \"peaked\" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself \"settling\" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a \"Introduction to Beer\" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society.

I told them I wanted to take a break from school since it stresses me out and gives me more anxiety but they still want me to go. They have told me that I will be paying for my own insurance and basically everything and I do not even know what to do. And my messed up head keeps telling me that the easiest way out is to kill myself.I know that I have people who care about me. I know people love me. My parents love me, even though they are homophobic and I have not come out to them yet. My boyfriend loves me, even though I have not told him that I want to transition to male. My best friend loves me even though it is hard for me to open up to him.But there is that small part in me that does not give a fuck that they love and care about me. I can be selfish all I want, I have been trying all my life to be as selfless as I can. I do not care that you want me to live. I do not want to live and I want to do whatever the fuck I want, even if that means taking my own life to end this shitty cycle.I have always been suicidal. Just not actively. When I was younger I always thought about situations in which I died. It carried on to where I am now and I cannot go a few hours without thinking about suicide. Everything reminds me of death when I look at it - my bathtub, the neighbor's firepit, the train station, my own fucking car, my antidepressants, fuckI tried killing myself once before but the girl I loved saved my life and I regret never talking to her since.

{"id": "15217", "text": "Tldr: reccomending my favourite movie that I finally watched in the middle of my depression and suicidal tndancies. Now hear me out. But The Last Samurai. Loads of people rip on it for not being historically accurate in places and having a few Hollywood movie tropes. But when I came across this movie on TV and just watched it.. I was laying in bed all day everyday so upset with myself I was frustrated and wanting to cry but could never do it. It made me self harm out of frustration sometimes. But most of the time I was just numb laying down staring at the ceiling with the TV on in the back. As I was watching it I was relating to Tom cruises character more and more. (Suicidal and alcohol abusing man struggling with his past) It was the first thing that broke me out of constantly thinking in my head for months. Watching the movie. Seeing this man struggle and only end up doing the same thing over again hit home. Then getting captured broke the cycle, he started recovering from his alcoholism and started caring about things. Started caring for the child of the man he killed. He was finding a purpose. I always never understood people that say \"this book changed me\" \"this person snapped me out of it\" how can something just make you 180 on your feelings. But this movie started doing it for me. I was drawn in. Getting hope for this character and rooting for him. Then in the final battle scene, seeing this man that was broken, fighting for something he truly believed in. I am not ashamed to say I actually cried. I cried for about an hour. I was so happy that I was crying it made me cry more. Like I said before I always thought it was stupid or just a lie when people say stories or people just make them snap out of it. But this did it for me in a way. It was not overnight but it put the wheels in motion that there was hope. Its possible. I encourage you to watch it. It might not work. You might find it boring. Or you may be lucky like me and it snaps you out of your own mind and make you feel emotion again. Please keep trying it can get better. This movie helped me", "class": "Suicidal"}

I had so many friends, all of which I would say hello to on the way to class- now I do not even go outside anymore. You know, we did not even get a High School graduation? It was a Google slideshow with pictures that we submitted and our names on it. I now attend online classes in my college with barely anybody to talk to, and every time I click the leave button the smile vanishes from my face.My friends were my lifeline; my parents separated when I was young, and I suppose I would go to said friends to mitigate that feeling of family. I live with my mother, but she is endlessly working and always spends her sleeping or watching TV. She says she is working for my future- so that I can continue on in my life well set and without worry- but I wish she would stop worrying about how I feel in the future and worry about how I feel now. With her, almost every thing I do has something wrong. Its never enough: from the way I bring the groceries inside the house to the way I place the blanket over my body when I go to bed, there is always something that has to be corrected. She says she tells me these things so that I know how to do them properly, but she says them with such spite and anger that I cannot possibly believe that statement. I have tried to tell her how I feel on multiple occasions, but she does not understand; she tells me that these things are a part of life and that I should learn how to deal with them. Even if only once, I long for a stroke on the head and her voice to tell me that its all going to be okay.I wish I had someone to tell me that its going to be fine, someone to hold me and tell me that things are going to change for the better.

I do not know what the hell to do anymore.To shorten a very long story, I am a single dad stuck at home 100% of the time with 3 kids. Ex left me for a old boyfriend, sucked but whatever I got over it. I was able to work from home and help take care of the kids, keep things normal-ish. Thank God for my parents. Without their help Id have gone insane or more likely put a bullet in my mouth a long time ago.Things were going ok ish until covid. Suddenly the kids are stuck home all the time, bored and driving me crazy. Their mom is flaking out again so I am without much help. My oldest son is a nightmare. Long gone is the sweet boy I knew and hes replaced with a narcissistic psychopath. Yeah, yeah I know all teenagers are bad but no. I legitimately use the clinical definition of psychopath here. I 100% think hes about one life crisis away from the beginning of a Netflix true crime documentary on a serial killer.We tried therapy but it does not help. Hes a master at lying, deflecting and putting on whatever mask he thinks will work best for you at this moment. After the 3rd time he did not come home and the cops brought him back we had him go to an inpatient facility for teens. We all breathed a collective sigh. Finally peace for us and maybe just maybe he will get some help. Nope a few weeks later hes back and has not changed.For a while he was able to live with his mom most of the time. But her new marriage imploded and now she is quasi homeless. Great now I am back to them all being here 100% of the time, no end in sight. My parents can take the younger 2 for brief stints but cannot handle him, nor do I want them to have to.So here I sit at my kitchen table, staring down the barrel of at least 5 more years of this shit. I have a nicer prison than most I guess. Still able to work, buy shit for hobbies that I do not give a shit about anymore, sunlight and fresh air.I do not actually want to kill myself but dark thoughts are no stranger, and I am getting more comfortable with not being alive. Even started thinking about what ifs for after I am gone. The only comfort I get these days is eating so I figure my heart will give out within the next decade and solve the problem for me if things do not change.Well there it is, there is my story and yeah I do not feel any better. Hell I am not sure why I thought I would. I do not feel period these days. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk or something. Trapped", "class": "Depression"}

Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25/m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 1/2 years. She told me \"I am going to find someone better\" and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been \"beaten\". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for \"not wanting help\" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once. I just got this urge to tell someone everything about me. I hope i will not regret this.", "class": "Depression"}
{"id": "9691", "text": "I wish I could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all I really want in this life is to just be loved. To have someone who can actually touch me, most times I associate that with romance. &amp;#x200B;But it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. The last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. The nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. How sad is it that I remember that after 3 months?!&amp;#x200B;That was the only physical contact I have had in nearly 3 YEARS and you wonder why I am constantly thinking about suicide? Is it not obvious?&amp;#x200B;I just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. But it is too much to ask and I know it is. I cannot do \"slow\". Not only have I been cut off from physical contact, I have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. &amp;#x200B;I do not know anyone where I live, I only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. Seeing as how I am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. &amp;#x200B;I frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because I am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. But if I do not cook, then we do not eat. If I do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. &amp;#x200B;Seems every day is just the same. Wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all I can muster. &amp;#x200B;This life has taken so much from me and all I have ever asked for was love. I have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love.&amp;#x200B;It was a nice ideal while it lasted, I suppose. Because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. You got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things.&amp;#x200B;And yet, even as I have grown older, I still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999% of it is completely and entirely useless. &amp;#x200B;Just basic stuff, you know? Like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a TV, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. You could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. &amp;#x200B;How ironic, I suppose. I try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, I have the least amount of people in my life as well. Who would have thought?&amp;#x200B;I try to change, I try to convince myself that I can change. But I am still stuck here, in this reality and I cannot lie to myself. I cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. &amp;#x200B;In honesty, I just do not want anything anymore. I want to want, but I do not want. The motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. I doubt much of anything ever could be.&amp;#x200B;I have tried EVERY SINGLE THING I could find. Breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, I am even currently in therapy, I am taking medication every day and I suppose that is a +1 for me. I am starting to kind of build a morning routine and I am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference!&amp;#x200B;I am still alone!! I am still useless!! I still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! I get the slightest hint of attention and I am like a fucking lost puppy! I will follow you off a fucking cliff!! &amp;#x200B;None of this is factually making anything about my life better. I am still miserable, I am still addicted to video games and YouTube and now Reddit has fallen in along the lines so I guess you all are just going to need to ban me. So I can do \"more constructive things\" with my life.&amp;#x200B;As if I want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! And it is just EVERYTHING!!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to do all of this and be this person that I am not and I have to do it all alone because I am so fucking worthless and I have made some real shit decisions in my life!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after I pour out the darkest parts of me. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to believe that things can get better when I am not seeing any real results from anything I am doing. My teeth are getting a bit whiter, so I guess that is the only real plus there.&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like I am going to explode and if that gets cut off... You can kiss all this progress goodbye. &amp;#x200B;I have been starved for most of my life. In one way or another, or multiple ways. But I cannot ask people to understand that. I have to be the one to change and I cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since I am so damn sensitive to attention because I am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but I am supposed to just be ok with it. &amp;#x200B;Yeah, it is ok. it is ok.

{"id": "12510", "text": "TWI've gone on a very bad downward spiral again recently. I tried to take my own life back in '18, spent some days in the psych ward. Some of you have probably been there, too.Since then, I have not really gotten better - I have just crawled my way into surviving with a strenght I was not sure I had. Two weeks after the attempt I went back to work, and I now realize damn, that is so f\\* up. It was like \"now hurry up and be profitable again\"I quit that job last year, before the pandemic. Since then, I tried to get another job. I recently landed one which I was really hoping was just going to be something I could handle. Woop-dee-doo. How do I fool myself every time. Two months later, here we are - I collapsed, hard, this time more from my anxiety than from my depression. I just told my boss I was sick until I could figure out what to do. I called my psych; she knows me well. She told me she suggested at least a month off. I know this company would kick me to the curb if I take one month off, so I though it was better to resign saying I got another job offer, patch it up, bye bye.What else can I do other than try my hardest to fix the things this mental illness causes as best as I can? Nothing else.My mom understands. Not everything, because no one who has not had a mental illness can fully understand it. But she is supportive. she is been my anchor all this time. She is the sole reason I am typing today; I would, no doubt, be gone if she were gone. Things is, I moved back here last year, after quitting my job. The reason I moved was because my grandma, who I was living with since 2012, had a stroke and now needs a full-time caregiver. it is a two bedroom apartment, so I had to get out. I guess my stepfather, who \"sees me as daughter\" (pft) has not really liked that. I guess he feels, like always, as if I were here to try and steal my mom or something. I actually felt bad and I thought maybe I am being an obstacle between a couple, even though being honest and kind to myself (quite rare) I have helped the hell out of them after he was diagnosed cancer last year and I took care of the house while they were gone.I think now he just wants me out. I am quite impressed at his lack of care despite being a firsthand witness of my attempt in '18. I asked my mom because I felt something was off (they are gone til tomorrow). She said he, I quote, \"is worried that I will never be able to live on my own.\"I do not know if she does but I do see the meaning behind those words. it is a not very subtle \"get out of my house and leave me alone with my wife\". I guess I should have seen it coming, knowing the only love that is unconditional is my mom's. As I wrote down this post I calmed down a little bit. Right now I need to get back on my feet. I will resign from this job because there is no way I can handle it next week, or ever. I will work with my psychiatrist to get me back to \"semi functional\" as I like to call it. Then I am grabbing my money and I am getting the hell out. Screw this. Screw him and his expectations. He can shove his fake care and love up where light does not reach. He has the nerve to judge me, the nerve to expect me to go on after I collapse, when he has two kids (32 and 27) who have NEVER. WORKED.NEVER.I guess I kind of answered myself in this post, but I would still appreciate any input you might have. I feel stronger now. I feel angry. that is good - angry is better than guilty. Eventually I know I will just let go of him, because I do not live with resentment. How am I going to manage once I leave? I have no clue. But I cannot manage here anyway, either. And if I am not wanted, then I shall go.The good side of me still wishes him good. The good side of me cries at how stupid I am, because amidst having a mental breakdown I felt so happy that yesterday he was told his cancer treatment ends next month. I was so genuinely happy, because I do love him. I guess I am just not loved back. And you can tell me \"he loves me in his own way\", but I do not believe in that. You either love someone or you do not. Thank you for the space. I will be down, and up, and down, and up again. But I think eventually, I will just pack up my things and go. And remind myself, yet again, every day, that love is absolutely conditional.

I do not mean it got better, it got fucking worse as I could not go outside at all, and as a direct result of that, it became quite literally all I did. At this point, I got some records in Overwatch and a few other games which had validated in my mind that this was what I was built to do. I then met someone who I thought actually might not be a toxic cunt, but as of now I am having doubts because I think my damaged social skills and autism kind of made her turn her back to me.

{"id": "11156", "text": "I do not know where to start this story but I recently turned 18 and I have spent the past two years mostly unhappy and anxious, I hated who I am and where I came from. As my dad died when I was nine years old, I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building, at-least that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasons.I held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope. Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died. Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it. I am still not sure if that is the truth, but sense then I have never entered my balcony. These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with. This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors. I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay (I am bisexual) and awkward. I always went home in a bad mood because of this. Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates. I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed. I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners, because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues. When COVID-19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense. All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did, and I almost succeeded. As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity, that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am. All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently, I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future. Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous. I began hating myself for being jealous and I am spiraling back down to where I was, in the past few weeks I have already missed a few college assignments, I need help to cope with these emotions, I do not know what to do anymore.

I have been trying to get this engineering major finished since I was 26, now I am 30. it is going to still take another year and a half. it is not that I am not smart enough. it is that I have extremely debilitating undiagnosed issues that because me to self destruct and self harm. my level of self hatred is not negligible. people have seen it in me for years. men have told me things like that I have a chip on my shoulder, they ask me why I am doing what I am doing, they use me repeatedly because I have no defense. it is a curse being intelligent at the bottom, especially for a woman. it is almost too painful to describe. and the fact is that I take pains not to blame others and to shoulder burdens on my own. and it is never enough, it is never good enough. I am used up and ruined. the only time things were going well for me, someone greedy and evil saw my happiness and my earnestness and they pounced on me. tricked me, used me up. hurt me beyond measure. and i feel that I am screaming inside but no one seems to care. it is past the point of being too proud to ask for help, it is just that it seems I am asking too late. the efforts I make now seem to be tainted and cursed. having high expectations of myself translates into high expectations of others and when you are down down down in a bad place financially, mentally as a woman believe me the amount of people who judge and mistrust your character is much higher than those willing to be sympathetic or to do anything to help.I make the issue worse by watching misogynist propaganda i find online. I play into that mindset that I am just a dirty slut that deserves to get thrown away, because it hurts so badly to not understand why my life has been so cruel. it almost is a relief to just feel the abuse, feel that i deserve it now because it keeps finding me. what a cursed existence. all because i wanted more from life, and I truly believed that i had been short changed and that if I worked hard enough that things could get better for me. unfortunately for someone that has the label independent woman, it is pretty unappealing in all reality where i am at geographically. not terrible, no one stops me. but people are suspicious. and men seem to just have a sixth sense that my passionate spirit and easy to excite personality and my openness are just ripe to abuse and take advantage of. I have to move in 3 days, i have nowhere lined up. i broke my foot recently and i also got charges for smoking marijuana recently. i had to take medicaid so that i could get some kind of medical care, and i hate myself for what I have become and where I am at now. To me, I am a victim of circumstance and of ignorance (my own). yet no one cares about the particulars when you are down like I am, they just see someone emotionally out of control and our society, the world in general, treats women so disposably. I am extremely aware of my own disposability and the thrill or excitement or hope that allowed me to keep functioning in the past have been taken from me. &amp;#x200B;honestly, I am too overwhelmed to function and too stubborn to give up. I have never felt more misunderstood or more unattractive. I have thoughts of ending my life daily but i lie to the therapist about that because i do not want to end up in some lockdown or for it to be any more obvious how fucking insane I have gone from all of the despair. I feel strongly that at this point, because of my lifelong self destruction, that the only person who would really feel upset would be my mother. and even she is more than aware of the neglect and abuse in my past so even she would probably have to acknowledge that the act has given me some sort of relief. Although she is so religious , maybe she would hate me for it. but it cannot be much worse than having to support your daughter who was ruined mentally by an abusive man and who has such misguided lofty aspirations when in reality, I am nothing more than a used up slut who is too old for a man to love. i know how skewed my perceptions are, it did not matter when i was functional, but now I am not. i do not want to face the consequences of the past . i want to give up because all of my idealism and hope are dead. and I am not even attractive or youthful or anything useful to a man anymore. yes I have got issues bad. i feel so worthless. i feel so hopeless. I am drawn to people that abuse me. I am a burden to the state and to my mother financially. I am not sexually driven or beautiful so i'have no worth to men. I have existed in misery without help for so long that nothing gives me happiness anymore and i attack those that try to help me because I have been hurt so many times. i want to gather all of my belongings, leave this place, leave my stuff with my mom and just drive away and find somewhere beautiful to end my life, alone and solitary and without anyone else around to hurt me. only myself just let me crawl away and die", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "8309", "text": "Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with \"What are you going to do?\". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like \"Oh I just cannot take you seriously\" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying \"NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg\" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as \"Oh gee I do not owe you anything\"Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of \"you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone\". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected \"If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?\" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me \"just be yourself\" or \"put some effort in\" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted.

{"id": "12025", "text": "Hey guys! My partner recently (2 months ago) suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown (for want of a better phrase). He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it, tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg (not the best idea but he panicked). A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown, the weeks prior being full of mood swings, irritable, quick to anger, irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine, cross-titrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks (8 weeks ago). After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, extreme paranoia (effecting our relationship), obsessive thoughts, total irrational thinking, an inability to keep the bad thoughts in, quick to anger, what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently, tunnel vision, all the rest, you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better, or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long? How long did it take for them to subside? What did you do to deal with them? Is there anything I can do to help?

I want to quit but my parents will say that I would be giving up something which I can do but just do not have the discipline to become better. So now I am at a crossroads. Hell, even now I am feeling stressed out cuz I know that other people have been through worse situations than this. How do I constantly do things which i hate to do", "class": "Depression"}

I honestly do not know. I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad, but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid, but I do not want to grow old alone, I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy. I feel like I am intruding on the fun that everyone is having and they keep me around because they feel bad. I have become socially awkward, I cannot keep eye contact with people like I used to. I do not want to feel like this anymore. Idk if I am legit autistic or I have some sort of developmental issue in my brain because I have always had friends younger than me and maybe I am stupid or something and my brain is stunted so I cannot relate to people my age.

I wanted the more expensive one because it had all the functions I every wanted but not needed. The cheaper one was just what we always had. We got the cheaper one, and I was really disappointed. Of course I helped paid for it.We then discussed household improvements. Replacing broken aircon units, installing ceiling fans to reduce aircon use. Replacing a deteriorating refrigerator. Many other little things and big things. All, in my mind, pretty important stuff. Some necessary, some quality of life changes. But We cannot afford it.I am crushed. Despite saving for several years, I do not even have enough for my meds. I have been getting bare minimum wage for a job I have worked 7 years for with no raise in sight. People in my position usually get at least 70% more than what I am earning, but here I am, earning less than a fresh graduate joining their first job. despite more experience, despite more responsibilities.I asked if our parents would help even a little. Maybe help us get a good contractor they trust, maybe a little financial help. I got shot down. Specially by my own family.that is when it hit me. I have become an entitled monster. I want things, and I wanted people to pay for it and give it to me like I deserved it. I wanted to demand a pay raise even though I probably do not deserve it. I keep wanting more than what I can afford, spending above my means, expect people to do it for me just so I can be happy. I have turned into a monster. Like all those entitled Karen out there that think the world owes them. I am now one of them, I was probably always one of them.No wonder my mother called me an entitled spoilt brat that is useless. That I am a waste of space and should not have been born. No wonder that old boss screamed at that its all my fault, that I am useless and always wrong. They both say I will never be entitled to anything. I will always be the scum of the earth. I am disgusting, a disappointment, a monster. And they knew it. And now I know it.I am pampered and spoilt for wanting people to help pay for what I want. I do not deserve a pay raise because I am not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard or how much I try and do. They know I am a monster, and monsters do not deserve anything. I am useless, hopeless, waste of space and everything is always my fault.I do not want to live anymore. Everyone will be happier without me.

When I was in the 10th grade, I tried a percocet for the first time with a group of my friends. It was that moment that haunts my life to this day. I upgraded to straight fentanyl after a while, and it became apparent that I did not make enough to afford my addiction. After ruining about all of my relationships by either stealing or borrowing money from my closest family and friends, I went on to ask random strangers Id see at the gas station or distant colleagues. My life was shit before the drug usage. Parents divorced, dad a drug addict, mom a whore, and me a bipolar, anxious, scared person- there was not an absolute reason I should not be using in my mind. After a couple of years of failed attempts of being off and on sober, I decided I was going to end it all. However, that did not work. My tolerance was to a point that made it very difficult to OD on. On my final attempt, however, I bought 30 pills. Stimulus check helped me there. I drove to a spot that was public so my body would be found, and I snorted 15 of those pills. After woken by police, it was obvious that did not work the way I wanted it to. Court ordered to rehab, I went through the entire 3 month program flawlessly. Using my previous knowledge of rehabilitations spit outs, and a some what will to make myself better, I came out feeling sad. I knew Id miss my peers and even some of the counselors. That brings us to a year later. I have stayed clean, however I have had constant suicidal thoughts and plans circling my mind for months. I do not know if I should or not, but I just want this dark comedy of a life to end. My friends do not talk to me. I miss both my ex girlfriends.

{"id": "10966", "text": "(sorry for bad english, I am from Italy and my English is not that good... I am using google translate)For a few months I started feeling sad and suicidal, it all started on April 6th. I ran away from home because I could no longer manage a strange feeling (like stress but with anxiety and sadness) and I found it as a method of release. A volunteer friend of mine helped me, from that moment she has always helped me and she has made me feel better, simply by integrating me into the activities that are done in my association. I finally felt good, after years of being locked away at home all the while hoping that the days would end soon. The problem? I have been an asshole. I continued to feel bad instead of trying to do better by causing problems and annoying everyone. Until, on April 26, I was forbidden to volunteer (for reasons related to my age, for nothing else) he did not write to me anymore, when he looks at me he avoids me and I returned to my life before, on a fucking chair sitting all day, near a computer, looking at the time every few minutes, hoping that the time to sleep is approaching as soon as possible. The first few weeks I was VERY BAD and I could hardly get out of bed. I started therapy with a psychiatrist and I go there every Monday. I continue for weeks to feel bad and feel suicidal in a very strong way, but over time these feelings have been felt less. Now I spend the weeks doing nothing, all the time on a screen, I swear it feels like torture, time never seems to pass and sometimes it seems to go by very fast, I arrive at the weekend without even knowing what I did (memory loss) and what worst is that I no longer feel anything other than this feeling of stress. Writing this I realized I was in a really shitty situation ... the only option I really know is suicide, but I do not want to die, I wish this hell would end. The worst thing is that I do not have any friends, I stay silent for weeks except when I have to talk to my father, who never cares about me for work.

{"id": "10356", "text": "it was a different day in a weird way, in an almost bad way. i saw someone explaining about once a person has mastered the art of acceptance, nothing can hurt them anymore. but that meant that the person had barely to almost no sympathy, i cannot see myself being like that especially to her. then later on i had a panic attack, i could not do anything it was a whole mess. the night was ruined. i was full of anger at myself, i was fully anguished. i accidentally showed that i was not doing well and was done with everything while talking to someone, i was terrified at what i had just done. my whole mind was a war zone, i was not thinking straight, this was the first time in a while i showed the emotion of not being able to handle it anymore to someone, i was scared because previous experiences especially with my ex did not end well, my heart was feeling every bit of nothing, just empty and shallow. but it did not end bad, i actually got a message about how much they cared about me, it made me feel a whole lot better but i still had to get because i felt as if i just embarrassed myself. in the middle of my heart tearing apart from the pain, it was nice. it was nice to even see that she would write its that much, yet alone she wrote me a paragraph about how much she cared about me. the past week I have been praying she would say something like that, I am so glad it happened because its still on my mind and its been almost 24 hours and i cannot get it off of my chest, its nice to see she cares so much. today_i hate how I am so late, I am the wrong person who was here at the right time once, but now the wrong person at the wrong time. almost as if i got the last piece of the cake, which was tiny compared to the other pieces. i hate how people ruined her experience and i cannot get a chance with her nor her full trust, but its how life goes; life is a whole lie. funny thing to mention she mentions how she likes girls and I am pretty sure its satire i think? but it does make me smile in a laughing matter but then i just realise that i really do not have any chances with her, I am just here. I have been unlucky my entire life leading up to this point, my dad hates me so much that I am not even hurt anymore when he says hurtful things to me its normal, my mum sometimes goes out of her conscience and supports him. but i feel so terrible, feel like a shitty son for hating them, and end up forgiving her and him, but then it happens all over again its a cycle of never ending pain. I have been unlucky for quite a while but if I am able to one day get her then ill be more than just satisfied, i just want to be her safe person. it would be a shame if i lost her to some other guy, even sadder if her jokes about her liking girls came true haha, but as long as that person can keep her happier than i ever could then ill be okay. i wish i could go back to the time when me and her first started talking, then till now, she is the most beautiful girl I have ever met, the most valuable smile and the most precious eyes, they were like gem stones but of an odd colour for a gem, i loved it so much when her eyes locked into mine, i was really floating. i messed up. i cannot make her happy and make her laugh like i used to be able to, I am losing the only bit of value to her that i ever had. i hope this nightmare ends one day, and i never wake up. i hope i get stuck between a nightmare ending and waking up, where I am waiting for nothing, just complete blank and am never able to make it out, my heart hurts more and more everyday, and I am too selfish taking care of myself and trying to heal that i cannot even help her. i not only wish to die but also feel like i deserve to. anyways, cya yesterday was a different day", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "19046", "text": "I am a 20 years old man. I got admitted into university mid-pandemic. While every student got together virtually and even with some meetups here and there, especially with some new friends we made, I became the one who knows much about my major and this made people respect me. However, I feel like I am just a Wikipedia between these people. One who is constantly respected but not for who he is but what he knows and how he helps them. It makes me happy, but not proud of myself.Suddenly, after years of isolation in middle school and high school, not being in contact of many people, I find myself amongst others. I started to feeling love for a girl. She rejected me. I see other men and boys in my surroundings. Always getting the love and attention I want to receive myself too. Some play guitar and music. Some watch movies. Some has read many literature and poetry. I feel like I am empty. I do not know many things people finds them very exciting. I cannot sing, cannot act, cannot tell a story which makes them laugh, cannot joke, cannot flirt because I have constant fear of being rude or becoming the creepy man, cannot dance, cannot work, basically, cannot be the person they like and even I wanted to be.I was open about my feelings towards some friends. I could rely on them to talk, even if some of them was aforementioned people with guitar and stuff that I think my shortcomings are attributed to me not having those abilities. They were always supportive of me. Many people of university always applause me for what I know. But I feel empty.I could not love, I could not be what I want, I could not fulfill my expectations or even my friends'. This makes me empty. I think of suicide more often. The only reason I have not done it is my parents. do not want to give them a hard time. But things are getting more tough. Even to the point that I am starting to ignore what could happen to my family and loved ones after I am gone.Even if you do not read this and will not help, I completely understand. I had to write it down somewhere which someone could read it. Maybe someone find my situation close to themselves and could help them. I do not know if I be here longer than usual. I have less and less dj vu. Maybe my days, hours, seconds, have got numbered. I hope I could one day get back and read this. Maybe laugh at my juvenile thoughts, or, be proud that I overcame it.

{"id": "12933", "text": "Joined a few months ago but this is my first post. I (26f) was diagnosed with clinical depression over 10 years ago and within this past year that diagnosis has changed to severe clinical depression + generalized anxiety disorder. Admittedly, I do not offer up this information freely aside from close friends and family not out of shame, more so hoping not to have triggering conversations in social/family situations. Anyway, growing up in an emotionally void and abusive household I have become such a people pleaser Ill often offer every ounce of my time, money, energy, resources etc. to those who need it which I have realized subconsciously I have been programmed to believe is the only way to receive love. These past two years have been so hard. Depression broke apart my engagement, lost me my dream job, and I have disconnected with essentially all of my friends because I am just too exhausted to reply or leave home outside of necessity. This week I began to take baby steps toward feeling better including opening up to my loved ones, starting therapy, and medication. Next was my financial situation which I have ignored (this was quite scary) but I knew I had to start facing things scared or not. My absolute closest friend had been trying to plan a trip across the country that I would love to love to attend but truthfully, was so daunting as the date neared closer. Finally today I faced this pile of bills and realized there was no way I could attend this extravagant trip and rationally spend $1500 or so for it (we had not booked flights yet which were $500 alone). I knew I had to have a really difficult conversation and finally today I did. As raw and honest as possible about the reasons Id not known this sooner and how I could not bare the thought of them being upset with me over it. I apologized profusely as this is a result of my own actions. They are upset, not necessarily at me directly but says they just want to make alternate plans with their bf. I am so relieved to not worry about this trip anymore, but now I worry my negligence toward myself has really lost me another friend now. Put myself first for once.

{"id": "19173", "text": "This has been a theme in my life since the end of school at 18. Big changes scare me, but mostly make me feel really sad and empty. When school ended, friends moved away, life routine changed completely, and I remember feeling a big void in my life/depression for a few years after (my Bachelor experience was not fulfilling and my social life did not progress much).Eventually in 2019 I got an internship and hated it for a couple weeks (again the fear of change). I was wrong. It turned out to be the best thing that had happened to me in years, I got a first work experience, had a routine again, made a great friend and loved the people there. After 5-6 months though it was coming to an end again and that same feeling of emptiness crept up. I started my Masters degree in a new city and again was scared and unhappy for a while. Again, I was wrong. My first semester was good and I made a few decent friends, but did not go out much. The pandemic happened and that was honestly mentally fine for me since there were not many expectations and I was able to talk to school friends online and got great grades/started to deepen my friendships in my new city. 2021 was socially fantastic for me since one of these Uni friends has become one of my best friends and I care about her a ton. There were a lot of stresses this year including writing our thesis and job search, but I consider those positive stresses. Me and her had those two things in common and we would go for drinks/hang out all the time to motivate each other and talk out any problems in our lives.I finished my thesis and therefore my Masters degree (assuming I pass) 2 weeks ago now. That feeling is coming up again and I hate that it is. Despite any stresses, I was so happy these last couple years during my Masters and it feels like life is once again changing just as I am feeling comfortable. My friend is on a 4 week vacation and so that support system is not there right now and she is got a job lined up in a different city (about an hour away) starting in September (that is also my goal in terms of time and even location).It annoys me so much that I feel like this. By all accounts, my life is pretty good. I have got some great friends, I have supportive parents, I have a great education, I am not struggling financially at the moment, and I have got lots of opportunities ahead. That being said, I cannot escape this feeling of emptiness I experience at every big change in my life. I always feel as though my friends have their lives planned out and have no issue keeping to that plan, while I am always unsure about my future and really negative about big changes.Is there anything I can do to see my life differently and see openings as opportunities instead of threats? How do you avoid feeling sad when life changes significantly?", "class": "Depression"}

It carried on for 3 months whilst I lived in a complete fantasy land of my own making. 5 years of happiness, of future plans and excitement, extinguished in an instant. He moved out 6 months ago. I still see him from time to time. Him and her are not together. I still love him. He cares about me, but only through guilt.I do not want to hurt him, but I am hurting myself by continuing to be here. The thing is, I forgive him. I forgive him for what he did to me and our lives. he will be better off not having to worry about me anymore. he will be able to get back together with her and no longer feel guilt.

Please if you feel like something is wrong just forget google is there and go to the doctor. The bullshit written on google can seriously worsen your mental health and lead to severe depression. that is what happend to me. I was already depressed but the last month was probably the worst time of my life and it all started over using google for symptoms. I had just read an article about different types of cancer and what symptoms to look out when I realised something was not right (kind of private so will not go in detail) . Long story short after searching google for hours I came to the conclusion that I am experiencing a common cancer symptom. So I instantly call my doctor but he was not available so I had to wait 2 weeks for him to be available and than some for the test results to come out. During this almost 1 month of waiting I completely destroyed my already weak mental. I was constantly imagining scenarios in my head where I get diagnosed with cancer or some other dangerous condition. I could not sleep or do anyting other than sit in my bed and worry. More symptoms kept appearing and my health kept worsening. I seriously considered suicide as my life was not that good already and being diagnosed with something horrible would have been the nail in the coffin. My results came back and it turned out that it was not anything serious, most of the symptoms I was experiencing were stress based and I had tortured myself for nothing.

I have applied for endless jobs to try and improve, giving up on finding jobs relating to my degree (illustration and design), because the Northeast of England just does not have those kinds of opportunities. I work freelance, and have tried running an Etsy selling merchandise, but have been on a 2 year hiatus because I am slowly losing the will to see why.I have applied for so many jobs and constantly get rejections, my manager was kind enough to offer me receptionist shifts now and then. But even with that experience I am still not good enough. I recently dabbled in OF, not for money related reasons, but for some kind of self-love and confidence boost. I stopped because it felt pointless, even when earning a little. I also stream occasionally for fun, but I have even lost enjoyment from that. I am at a point where I just no longer want to exist. I have been in bed for days and feel a burden to my partner, who has been ever so kind to me. I feel like I do not deserve his help in all honestly. I tried ringing my doctor about some therapy, I was referred again to a UK company called Talking Changes, which were useless to me in the past. When I told my doctor this he just said well I cannot do anything else, so I never asked for help since, that was also 2 years ago.I tried talking to my parents about how I feel, and as I broke down crying, I was snapped at for being upset as it does not help anything and it is \"no use crying\". I just ended up driving home, whilst crying my eyes out. That was the last time I got out of bed, 4 days ago. I am not drinking anything, I am not eating, I just want to slowly shut down, because I see no end to this persistent hell.

I can totally understand where she is coming from and I am trying to do better, but its hard. I have been telling her for some time that I expect her to clean up after herself in common areas after a reasonable span of time (several hours to a day). This means cleaning the kitchen after cooking, throwing out old food in the fridge, vacuuming the dining room if the floor is dirty, cleaning up the ash from her bong (she self medicates with weed instead of going on antidepressants and seeking therapy), etc. it just feels like I am the only one making an effort to clean and she only cleans if I ask her to. The problem is, she says that executive functioning like cleaning is extremely difficult for her because she has depression and adhd. I can sympathize with her because I have OCD and mood regulation issues, but I have no trouble keeping the common areas clean and prefer to do so. I just cannot be the only one doing it. I have tried explaining to her that I love living with her, but its just frustrating being the only one who makes an effort to keep things clean. She takes this as me calling her lazy and disgusting, even though I have never called her those things. She has this idea that everyone secretly hates her and will grow tired and abandon her, and me being annoyed at her not cleaning is just a sign this is true.

{"id": "8321", "text": "Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself", "class": "Suicidal"}

I have been at a call center job for 2 years prior to covid, and was entering my 5th year of a bach degree in 2020. I have essentially gone from being a full time student, part time call center worker, and part time active community member to absolutely nothing. More recently, I had an intense breakdown from a manic episode that soured and threw me into a deep and angry but apathetic depression. I have had a pain flare that is made me 100% unable to function at work, so I am (very thankfully) on disability pay from my job, and though I had to drop out of college the last semester, do a bunch of overhaul with credit transfers, I can now finish in an upcoming fall semester and a 2 week program the following summer and I would be graduated. I have got doctors appointments coming up to see if I can get answers for my chronic pain. I have all of these things look forward to, all these remedies, but all I can feel is fear and anxiety and an overwhelming desire to end my life.I am floating between at a fibromyalgia diagnosis right now and I am having some of the absolute worst pain of my life. The medication I have been put on has me exhausted for most of the day, shaking, and slow. I am just a blob right now. Different professionals have put me on a combo of a bunch of meds to mitigate anxiety, mood stability, etc. I am probably going to need a lumbar puncture as an MS diagnosis could be on the table and I have a blood draw tomorrow.I just feel like a hassle. Like, I go to seek help and am getting it slowly, but I am stuck dwelling on the idea that all these things are a waste of time. The I am just being a resource leech and nothing else, because who tf am I to be asking for extra assistance- and why provide it to someone who might commit anyway? I feel so selfish and self centered.I have got opportunities coming my way but I am so so afraid to move forward. I feel like I should have committed during 2020, but could not go through with it. I feel so awful when people put their necks out for me, only for me to fail or do a so-so job, to disappoint them. Coming back to my job, I need to confront a bunch of little errors from my calls, acknowledge and go over my work processes in depth and put my work under intense scrutiny when in fact I have made customer service mistakes, transferred someone to the wrong department, or fail to answer one of many many questions regarding vehicle accidents. coming back to work means more accountability.

No boyfriend and I cannot seem to connect with new people, probably because of the BDP. Struggling with an ED (anorexia in the past) and currently binging everyday because of the alcohol, also having a new job deeply triggering everything mentioned before because I am left alone for days. I cannot handle any responsibilities and I am really failing life. I am tired of having to fight my own mind, and that crippling emptyness. I am thinking of just getting enough money to flight to a new country, explore for a bit and then when raining out of money (will be real quick) finally killing myself for good.I swear I just wanted to be happy for a bit, guess I do not deserve it.

At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but all I want to do is cry. Fuck, I need a hug. vent", "class": "Depression"}

My friends did not reach out to me, I always had to reach out to them. It was just really obvious these past 2 months that they do not care, never did they reach out and even ask if I was okay. Just nothing. The fact that I am a lonely loser just amplified itself these past 2 months.I always thought that reaching out to a friend that you think is having a bad day was normal. My friends all knew I have depression and yet not one message of comfort was sent to me. Friends were always important to me my whole life but now that I am experiencing life after school, everything just feels so hopeless. I am stuck with depression and it feels like no matter what I do, I cannot just get rid of it. My friends always said to improve myself and whatnot, if it was that simple then I would not be this depressed and suicidal.I just felt so lonely these past 2 months. After I reached out one last time to one of my friends, he said the reason they do not reach out and check up on me is that \"we are adults now\". After he said I should just toughen up. Those words have been stuck in my head the past week. I do not know what is right or wrong anymore but what I do know is that I want to move on, I simply do not want to live anymore.Just then I removed them all from my social medias and friends lists. The amount of pain I went through my life just outweighs any good that happened. I never had a girlfriend at all and the fear of being lonely forever is eating away at me. Seeing that those friends do not care enough just made me more and more depressed by the day. Being told to toughen up is just bullshit.

They never forced me do anything and never pressurised me to perform great in school. I did not have a bad social life either there was no bullying in my school, I had good at social interactions with my peers and teachers, and had a great rapo with them. My father came from nothing and achieved everything himself. I feel a pressure to out do him but nobody is telling me to do so. I have screwed up my life academically, I never had to work hard to achieve anything, I was good at sports and academics but slowly as competition started to increase i gave up on things and retreated. I started consoling myself that somehow I am destined to be sucessful and I started to belive it. Everytime I sleep, I hope I do not wake up tomorrow or if I do wake up , I wake up when i was 13 yrs old so I can re do my life with the current wisdom. Everytime my family goes out on vacation I hope they do not come back (die) so I can have an excuse for the failure I will become in future. The only reason I am not killing my self is because I do not want my parents to suffer due to me as they did everything right and provided everything for me. I hope everybody forgets about my existence just so I can just leave. I am lost I do not know what is ahead", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "17143", "text": "After a drought in therapy I went back to seeing a therapist and seeking help with anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds about a year and a half ago. My primary gave me a short list of recommended therapists and I was lucky enough to have gotten a call back from Wendy. I had almost given up on her after waiting for a call back. But she called me back. We met just once in person in 2020 and then throughout COVID it was all virtual once per week.My previous therapist had the philosophy that it was ok if I did not have a topic/ story/ issue/ something to talk about during our sessions and that it was fine to sit quietly and be comfortable with the silence. Well, it was not with me. It was paying a co-pay to stare at one another uncomfortably but with Wendy it was the opposite experience- supportive, proactive, caring, understanding and she reached out to me as I am generally an introvert. She brought me from being completely disbelieving of her early prognosis of me being emotionally abused from a child to a young adult and experiencing the symptom of PTSD to where I am now- that she was right all along. She was amazingly intuitive and I know that she was right. We were on the path to beginning EMDR and beginning resourcing and starting to meet in person once we had both been fully vaccinated. Things were moving along and once I had accepted the diagnosis of abuse and PTSD I was amazingly emotionally fragile and needy as all of my prior mental support systems and coping mechanisms as faulty and improper as they were had been erased. But she was there for me. All of the time. Last week we had a Tuesday meeting. All normal. We were to meet on Thursday again that week. I walked in on Thursday to find the lights in her waiting room turned off. Odd, but not too strange, I turned them on and waited and waited and waited until twenty minutes past our appointment time. I texted her, called her (straight to VM...) and finally knocked on her door. Locked. Silent. For her to not respond was entirely unusual and I knew then that something was very, very wrong. I waited for an hour but no Wendy.Finally, I left. Tried calling her that night. Her inbox now was full and I knew that I was not the only one looking for her. It turned out that she had been reported as missing the day before. Her car was found about an hour north of where she lived in a seasonal home's driveway. Her last known cell activity was there but there was no sign of her until they found her body a few miles off shore a couple of days later.I was lost. I am lost. I will never know what exactly happened to her- suicide, an accident or whether it was foul play ( because of death has not been released yet...) but I cannot understand it. I do not know how to move on. I know that I need therapy again. I need to move from this temporary holding pattern that we had established pre-EMDR but I feel enormously guilty about moving to a new therapist. it is like cheating on her. And besides the sheer enormity of starting from the beginning with someone new and gaining their trust and understanding. Add to this the fact that very few in-network therapists are accepting new patients right now (probably due to post-COVID stress...) and it is touching all of my triggers- being rejected, turned away, not wanted, etc...Shit... sorry this is so long but I really needed to get this off my chest to an impartial audience that Wendy would have fulfilled prior to now. Any advice, kind words, anything would be welcome. Lost My Therapist, Now What?", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "19811", "text": "Today, my parents and I had a conversation about my future. I told them I just wanted a job with a decent paycheck, because as long as you have enough money to get by that is all that matters right? They told me that I am too young to specifically choose a job, and then my dad asked me whether I liked sciences or arts more. Personally, I like arts more, but I do not even have any fucking time to learn to draw and animate. Why, you may ask? it is because my mom signed me up for so many classes that, especially during the weekdays, I hardly even have time to sit down. I cannot teach myself because digital art software always costs money and I cannot pay for anything online because I am too young to have PayPal, and it takes time that I do not have to learn how to use the software. Anyways, back to the conversation with my parents, I told them that I do not really have any choice but to become a doctor, and my dad said that I do not have to, but then he also told me that I should not really choose arts because apparently it is vague and you cannot really get a job in that. Then, both my parents started going on and on about how I should focus on my studies. My dad even told me that I should stop watching TV and YouTube and playing video games. Using social media and YouTube is my only refuge, the only thing that gets even remotely close to making me feel better. I am too young to choose a specific career path but too old to relax? It just does not make sense to me. He told me that it would only be until I finish my O-Levels and A-levels (O and A Levels are what we have for high school in my country, O-Levels is 3 years and A-Levels is 2 years), but I know very well that I will be just as busy even after graduating. I do not really like studying, I do not even have a favorite subject anymore because of how much I hate studying, it just makes me feel so trapped, that shoving my face in textbooks all day is the only way to success. Both my parents kept saying that I have to work hard, work hard, but to me getting out of bed is hard enough, let alone working. I did not mention that whatever mental illness I have (I have not been diagnosed yet so I cannot be sure) makes doing anything hard for me, because they would say that it is laziness not mental illness. Who knows, maybe I am just a lazy ass trying to make excuses. I told my parents that I did not want to become a doctor because it is not my passion and it is stressful. My dad told me, \"Oh it is not that stressful you can work in a clinic 9 to 5\" My mom tried to tell me some story about how she wanted to become a banker but she could not and that I cannot achieve my dreams because imagination is different from reality. Yeah, I already know that, I did not need her to remind me. I tried to tell her that I already know, but my dad said something along the lines of, \"Oh why did you stop her like that that is disrespectful is that how you talk to your mom?\" I had no choice but to stop that conversation because I was about to cry, and whenever I cry in front of my parents they give me shit advice when 90% of the time when I cry I really just want to be cuddled until I feel better. All in all, the conversation confused me, because my parents told me that whatever job I get should make me happy and that they are not forcing me to be a doctor, but at the same time what they said was definitely trying to push me towards becoming a doctor. Why else would they be telling me how good becoming a doctor is?Maybe my mom was right. Maybe it is time to say goodbye to me wanting to be an animator, or a voice actor, or an author or maybe a teacher, because I have to become a doctor to pay the bills and it is also my duty apparently to make my parents happy and to take care of them when they get old.However, if this is the life I have to live, I do not want to live at all.Goodbye dreams, it was nice knowing you. it is so fucking painful knowing that I have to let go of my dreams", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "15343", "text": "Last year my best friend passed away in her sleep. She meant the world to not only me, but, my wife too. They were the best of friends. She gave us a glimmer in this world, of hope; everything really could get better. Financial stability was not easy to come by due to covid, and we lived with some really bad people. We were very much obliged when she helped us get back on our feet. Alas, her health had gotten to a point where she could not exactly take care of herself as much she used to. We offered to take care of her accordingly, but.. it was too late.This year.. when it felt like everything would bounce back after the 'year that did not happen' came to pass, our eyes opened wider. A family friend of over fifteen+ years had committed suicide. Simply put, this sweet man just could not do it anymore. He had been struggling far more than we all imagined. Needless to say, and to not get incredibly personal, the light of his world had more or less given up on him prior. She wanted to call it quits with a divorce. That killed him quicker than any poison I have ever seen kill a man. He was battling his own demons indeed - and we truly did not see everything from behind the scenes. But, we knew, and always had our arms open offering guidance. But, ..it was still too late.we have seen many people come, and go since these devastating events have occurred. Everyday we grow further apart with what we thought was a friend group. I have lost countless friends to drugs, sickness and crime. My wife, and I have helped many through every possible tragedy, and life stressors to finally get to the point where we have nobody left to help, so to speak. Everyone seems to move on.. I cannot find the light anymore. I cannot find a reason to smile. If it was not for my wife, I do not know what I would do. I will be celebrating my birthday on the 25th alone with her.I have no friends, truly. Only memories. I live in a world without color, and I am afraid I lost my smile forever.

{"id": "9950", "text": "So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer.

{"id": "12569", "text": "I am struggling a lot with my life at the moment. I am 24 and basically just feel very lost / making no progress. I also feel like there is a lot wrong with me, this post will be a ramble.I feel as though my career is moving very slowly. I have a degree, but it is essentially worthless as it is a mediocre grade, and not in a specific area. My current job does not pay very well, and you do not need qualifications to get the position I am currently in. I have tried and failed to get a better paying job, I cannot help but feel that I would have been much better off working straight after finishing school at 16 and working my way up somewhere rather than going to university. Some of my peers have done this and are in a much better place in terms of earnings, house ownership, car etc. than me. I decided to start studying for an extra qualification in my spare time to boost my earnings potential. While I think that this was most likely a good decision, it does feel as though it is not going to get me where I need to be on its own, maybe upping my salary potential by around 5k. it is costing me around 2000 to do, and now that I have been doing it a few months the initial novelty has worn off and it is starting to drain me having to do extra studying after a full day's work, especially with the knowledge that I will most likely have to study a higher qualification on top after completing this one to achieve a decent salary anyway. I have no idea what I want to do in life and never have, I have just taken a route in something that I know I can do easily, and am taking the natural steps to progress. But the whole time I cannot help but feel like I will never find something that I ever really want to do, the only reason I am doing any of this is to earn more money, and the things I am doing are not even a guarantee of that anyway.Currently I live at home with my parents. I am saving up every month for a deposit for a house as I would much rather do that than rent, but the cost of housing is just going up and up, and the salary required to afford a property / mortgage is way above what I am earning. The older I get the more desperate I am getting to move out but it seriously just feels as though it is getting further away rather than closer. I feel like I am just in a hamster wheel and not getting any closer to any of these goals. I do not mind my parents, they are not terrible and living at home does have its benefits, but I am closer to 25 than I am to my 24th birthday now and at this point I am fed up and need my own space. But it just feels as though it is so far away, and even when I try and break it down it just feels like such an impossible task.Mentally I am in a terrible place. I have been for a while, my self esteem is awful, I am really struggling with everything at the moment. I self harm, frequently have depressing thoughts and am just generally unhappy. I suspect I probably have some undiagnosed disorder, when I browse the symptoms of BPD it is like checking off a list. But the process of getting treatment / therapy is incredibly long and expensive, and I honestly have no idea where to start. it is so expensive that I feel seeking out therapy when I have not really experienced anything traumatic enough for it just feels like a waste, and it is going to set back my other financial goals even more. On top of that I am trying to balance studying in my spare time and everything else, I just do not know how I would have the time.Socially I barely have any friends. I would say I have 3 truly good friends, 2 of them live far away so seeing them on a regular basis is not easy, and again is expensive. I only have 1 friend that I can see without travelling at least 90 mins. There is a huge age gap with 90% of my work colleagues. A few months ago my girlfriend broke up with me, which to be honest completely broke me. That relationship was something I thought was truly going well in my life but at some point she decided otherwise, she had her reasons, shit happens. She made clear it was nothing I had done and was not my fault but it is really hard to accept that. I am a lot better now than I was 1-2 months after it happened but it still affects me every day. I have no idea how I am going to trust anyone in the future in terms of a relationship. I also feel as though I am in no state to even be in a relationship anyway having written all the above stuff down. But it is just another thing that gets to me, I feel quite lonely as it is, and she was really good to me and it was a loss of a good friend in a way too. I feel like I am doing something wrong in relationships, I have never had a true, multi year long term relationship. I have no idea what it is about me that is not good enough. I do not pour all my problems out like this to partners. Sometimes it is discussed but I made a point to never burden my ex with all my problems like this. Yet here I am alone anyway. I cannot help but feel there is just some negative aura that people sense and do not want to be around me anymore.After the above happened I tried so hard to get into new stuff. I started doing new hobbies, things that I had not done before. Exercising more than ever before, all the usual things people tell you to do. And it just does not help. I have even been on holiday, which was a welcome distraction, but coming back home and back to reality it just feels as though my life is not going anywhere. The past few days I have just been so deflated. All my usual hobbies no longer interest me, I just have no desire to do anything that I normally do. I do not know enough people and I crave socialising, but if I try going to a club or something I just get so socially awkward / anxious. I am desperately craving some excitement in my life, the only things that are appealing are drinking, which I am really trying to avoid at the moment as it just makes me feel so much worse afterwards. I get tempted by gambling, but even that stops interesting me, unless the amounts are high enough to be risky. But I know I do not have the disposable income to play around with that anyway.I am absolutely sick of social media, I hate it so much. I hate how fake everything is. I deleted the majority of my social media apps. I am completely fed up of the news, it feels like everything you read online is so negative and depressing. And on top of all that like everyone else I am sick to death of covid, that in itself just feels like one step forward, 2 steps back. The government in the UK constantly contradicts and goes back on their own advice. And yet I know even if Covid was gone I would still be in the exact same spot I am now. I feel myself turning bitter and angry at everything which in turn would just make me even worse to be around. Everything is just building up and I have no idea what to do about it, the best way I can describe is I feel like I am playing life on hard mode.Yet there is nothing really wrong with me. Ok maybe I am depressed? But I have no physical disabilities, I have no disease, I have not suffered anything traumatic, I do not have a broken family, I am not stupid, I have a job, I have some qualifications, I have a car, I have some friends. I know I have a lot of things that many people would be grateful for. And yet I cannot help but just feel so *broken*.If anyone's read this far thank you, if anyone decides to share their thoughts thank you even more.

{"id": "11812", "text": "Hello! it is a rather long story, basically my whole life and how my parents' behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really, really sad.I am 20yo at the moment, female, but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 13. I am not diagnosed with depression, have not been able to go the psychotherapy, because my parents think I am joking and it is over exaggerated. Back in 2014, when I was hitting puberty, I had an awful summer where I realized everything is meaningless and whatever I do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my \"nihilistic\" phase, crying all day that I am useless, I have no friends, no one to understand me, nothing. It was rather unusual, because my mom has given me love all my life, my father was a bit on the cold side, as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me. All in all, my 2014 summer was pretty sad, I told my mom about it and that I wanted to see a psychiatrist, because I did not feel too well, but she brushed it off with: \"If you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30\" - its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health. During the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase, decided that even though everything is meaningless, you can still enjoy the good things in life. I still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself, end it all, being unbothrred with everything, crying over boys, broken hearted and many more occasions. Overall, I still had that \"it is whatever if I live or die today\" and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love, when it was raining, when my parents put me down for not being the first in maths/physics competitions, had different POV from their, wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could, enjoy life, they are basically super strict and did not allow me lots of things, even when i begged. I was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21, no joke here.Ff to 2020, I finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy, even keep it in a secret, and love him and enjoy life. I am also studying abroad in the Netherlands, first year student so we keep it long distance. it is 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf, i am crying all the time, i am also struggling with uni and just cannot stand it anymore, to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country. My parents are happy, I am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni. They are pretty chill, because I have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better. Ff May 2021, my parents become super toxic, telling me how i should study, spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that, to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago. They become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel, that i have a bf and all the things i cannot do. I do so, and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back, sit down and talk with them. I do so, we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation, they \"let me see\" my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind - that i shall keep studying. I have no problem with that and ff 2 months, they are back on their old shit, telling me that if i do not pass my exams i can never see him, that I am not trying as hard as i can, that ill end up as a 7/11 worker, that all I am interested in now is only sex and much more things I will not write down. I scream out loud during one fight that I am fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking, they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what is going on in my mind.Today i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it, when neither me nor her was talking she just commented \"or you are going to tell us that you are going to kill yourself again\" - like it was a fucking joke and i do not feel that way. I am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself, i cannot stand this anymore, its been every 2/3 days, its like they just cannot understand me and just want to obey everything they say. i do not even know if it is just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems, I am just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated.

Yet, i still feel like nothing can make me happy. Things i used to enjoy are no longer fun, and i have no new interests at all... feels like things are not \"worthy\" (like \"oh, ofc i want to play guitar, but uh, it takes so much effort, i do not want to anymore).

I do not want to kill myself, but i do think about, and i figured out i woudnt do it because ending it now feels like a selfish decision to my parents, my dog and probably half the world whom would envy my life.

So here is the meat of the issue: there is absolutely no point to life and/or living. Living makes zero sense and the only logical thing to do is death. And the more I try to distance myself from this shit the more it pursues me. I cannot see the point of life and living, which is not even the biggest issue in and of itself, but I can see a truckload of reasons to die. Guess that is where I am at: no reasons to live, but too many to count to end it.Wherever I google reasons to keep going, all that comes up is stuff like \"tomorrow is another day\", \"it is going to get better if you give it some time\" and \"just get through today\". HEY ASSHOLE! How about after 3.000 (literally) *another day* that sentence seems more like a threat than a message of hope? How about it not getting better? How about getting through today is THE VERY REASON for this? there is only so many *todays* you can get through.Some are even worse, like \"try new things\", \"change how you do things\" and \"Jesus loves you\". The first two basically do not even consider that it might go both ways, whereas the last... Not even going to address it. Honestly, I guess if I could believe (however I cannot, and also am conflicted about it) then it would trick me into the whole \"divine plan\" kind of thing which, as stupid as it is, at least would make it all make sense.Also why bother going to a shrink? To what? Get myself pumped up on drugs that will numb me and, supposedly, get me through another 30 years of this shit? it is not like it would solve the core issue. It would not provide for immortality, hence still ending up in the same place through different means, nor would it give life purpose. So to speak, ignoring truth does not make it less true.I do realize most of the mainstream stuff has the purpose of getting the people who are going through a specific moment and after that they can go back to normal. But what about... people like... me? Those for whom \"this\" is normal. It is abhorrent to think that once all the layers of BS are stripped, all that is left is a world of pain, nothingness, suffering and decay. And if you think I am selfish well FUCK YOU! Had I been selfish probably my life would not have been the total shitshow that it was/is, and I would not be here (mentally, not on reddit).Is it really eating, sleeping, sex, work, drugs and defecating all there really is to life? And do not give me the whole \"human emotions\" crap, we all know those are just chemicals released by our bodies (and easily created in a lab) to make us perceive something that logically is not there. it is so bad to be in the tunnel and realize the light is a lie (pardon the lame videogame homage).I feel pretty pathetic for writing this, but at this point might aswell post it and see if someone has an answer to offer. no idea why I am doing this but looking for an answer", "class": "Suicidal"}

I have become so numb to everything that it hurts to think about how much I have changed..I tend to keep myself from relationships due to my emotional unavailability from depression because I will know that anyone I date will just feel ignored. I do not want to hurt anyone and do genuinely care about people, even if they do not care about me.I am terrible at explaining my emotions and I apologize ahead of time if this sounds jumbled and repetitive. When I was 10 I was raped. As a male I was pretty much ignored because my attacker was female and it sucked. Losing 2 loved ones to cancer, my dad had a stroke, and my mom was unavailable because she had to take care of my father. When I finally told my parents they supported me fully and took very good care of me to get mental health support. My life has been pretty much existing day to day. Not living, just existing. I feel completely numb and have spent most of my days begging to God for something to change, pleading that my life will be better but it has not. I have tried several coping skills for depression but they always seem to be temporary and never last no matter how long I use them.Over the years I have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. All of which culminate into a bundle of nerves and depression that desperately wishes for the touch of others yet is too scared to let anyone near him or get to know him. My friends that do genuinely know me and care for me have stuck with me for years and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life.My sister is my best friend and she has helped me through so many issues that I could never repay her for. I feel guilty for venting to her sometimes though because she has her own issues and she does not need more to add to her pile.Most of my day is spent sleeping, eating, and reading or playing video games on the occasion where I feel even remotely alive enough to do so.I have never self harmed or attempted suicide and never plan on it for the sake of my family and friends but that does not mean I do not wish I did not exist sometimes. I hate myself for what I have become and worry every single day that I will become nothing and end up somehow more worthless than I already am. I know I am intelligent (please do not think I am bragging I promise you I am not), and that is the worst part. I know I have potential, but I am so downtrodden and depressed that I have no motivation or drive to accomplish anything. My love for history and geography is something that I cling to, because I do not have much left.So here I am, here is all that I am, and I do not know what I am doing anymore.

I spent the past many years struggling to figure out if this is me or if its the people around me, and I cannot figure it out. So I am wondering, do you have friends who support you through the good and the bad? What does this support look like? Will they listen to your feelings and struggles? Do you have friends who will check in once in a while to see how you are doing?Are these things too much to hope for in a friend? Is depression really just an isolated journey, where I can expect to have no close friends/relationships until I find a way out of depression? Do you have supporting friends?", "class": "Depression"}

Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant.

We are put in a rat race no one really wants to take part in. And that 1% not only is a super-selfish group of men living better at the expense of other humans, but at the expense of the planet. Most humans celebrate them as smart, but if they were really that smart they would find a way to live that life without hurting other humans and the planet. The truth is they are just born rich and so selfish that they would do anything to have more money. But also everyone would do everything for more money just yesterday I came across a dude who faked being deaf to ask money for a charity and I was falling for it. I hate myself, everyone around me and humanity", "class": "Suicidal"}

I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend, because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy, I started actually texting people back, I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up, and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit, so I drank way too much, picked a fight with a friend, then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day, and was immediately overwhelmed with time-sensitive, critical tasks that came out of nowhere. Then Thursday night, my cat got sick and spent 2 nights at the emergency vet hospital. She might have cancer, but at least she is back home now and seeming better.I am at work right now, staring at the list of shit I have to do that is too long, too full of overdue stuff that I will never have time to do, and I just cannot fucking engage. I have been in this job for 2 years now and I want some career growth but I do not have the time or energy to apply to stuff. I missed out on applying to a really great opportunity because I was puking my guts out when the deadline passed.I just feel like I will never reach that surface. Nothing will ever get better, I will never grow and be more successful, I will never be able to maintain relationships, I will never be able to lead a good life.I just want to fucking die but I cannot seem to figure out a good suicide method.

{"id": "12309", "text": "Original comment was in French. Shitty translation by me.The problem would first come from people that would be manipulated, and that would go kill themselves because of the pressure coming from an evil-minded entourage. Then, things always end up getting better, and a suicidal person by definition cannot realise that, giving an easy way for someone to kill themselves would necessarily increase suicide rates. Suicide is not a right, it is a selfish act whose consequences are dramatic for the victim's entire entourage, but not for the victim themselves. I have never heard about a suicide that would have made anyone happy, even for the victim, woe will always be better than nothingness.Woe will always be better than nothingness. I cannot explain how those words are straight up cruel. People want you to suffer rather than not existing. Those words are going to stick with me for the longest time. An unwelcome haunting.This is a sick world we live in. I wonder what impact this piece of shit was thinking his bullshit would have on me and other suicidal people. How can you tell that to someone suffering? How insane, how cruel do you have to be?Who are truly the selfish ones? WHO THE FUCK ARE THEY?But this is only a reflection, a foretaste of our entire society. I could never again bring myself to believe, even one second, in anyone's goodwill. Humanity is devoid of such thing. It is only cold and hostile. This is something someone replied to me as I was ranting about how suicide should be a right.

I can a hard time remembering things/learning and being motivated to get certain stuff done. Also I have an anxious tic that makes me jerk my neck when I am around people for more than a minute. I feel somewhat apathetic when it comes to dealing with other people emotional connections are and are not really there but I still feel very lonely sometimes and its hard to talk to other people. I have tried catting to people on reddit and apps but I just end always up getting ghosted so I have pretty much given up on doing that since its just going to go down to the same dead end road.I find it hard to return calls to cousins who just want to talk or check up on me.I just sit in my room 24/7 playing video games all day,watch videos, etc to just pass the time so I can go to sleep. I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well.

I have considered suicide at least 7 times in the past month which is the most I have ever considered in that span of time.Not only that but my only source of support IS my mother, and guess what, every time I say I want to kill myself, she adjusts my medication, NOT my psychiatrist, SHE adjusts the dosages of my medication, and if I do not do what she says I get grounded, get in trouble or whatever, I already cannot go on the internet past 12am because I yelled at her last month because I actually fucking hate her and do not want to deal with her shit.This has lead me to straight up wanting to kill myself, die, and not wanting to exist. Here are my several disabilities: 1. Asperger's Syndrome; High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (I do not care about people in conversations, all I want is to talk about myself, I do not care what other people have to say)2. Bipolar Disorder (I am a diagnosed Maniac)3. Tourette's Syndrome (Ticks; people apparently hate it when I sniff and I cannot help it)4.

{"id": "19321", "text": "This happened a little while ago but it still bothers me that the person who was supposed to help me did me so dirty. About 5 years ago now I was really struggling and made the decision to try therapy one more time as I finally had insurance that would cover part of it. Prior to this Id attempted therapy twice, once was 2 sessions with a student counselor through my college but I was ultimately told that the free counselors they could provide were not qualified to handle my range of trauma and that it would be better if a sought out a licensed therapist, which I could not afford. The next time I did try and go to someone who was licensed, they also told me I was not a good fit. I was seemingly functioning fine in the day to day (I thought I was, in retrospect not at all) and again my trauma was not their skill set. They suggested I seek out someone specialized. So I gave up for a while. It was not until my life was taking a major dive and I realized I was out of control to stop it that I tried again. Shortly before I began looking for a therapist, I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 26. In general, I am so pissed at not being listened to or just overlooked by doctors. That could be its own rant. But I was only diagnosed because I asked if it was possible. Id learned the actual symptoms of how ADHD presents in both women and adults for the first time and it was eye opening. So much of what Id complained about or told doctors I struggled with (attention, time management, zoning off) explained in one simple and now obvious thing. The tests were more than conclusive. So when I came across a therapist that specialized in ADHD along with, supposedly, some of my other specific traumas, I felt it would be good to be able to figure out a path forward with someone who understood how ADHD affects how I might function and think. The first red flag I should have paid more attention to, and I am still shocked by it. I had started to suspect I might be bipolar in addition to my depression, but was scared what that might mean for me. A few sessions in I brought it up. I still clearly remember her response: Oh no, you are not bipolar. You have cyclical depression. Bipolar you would have manic episodes where you think you can fly or kidnap a kid and think its your own, or *do really impulsive, damaging things*. I said the last bit sounds like me and she said But you do not think you can fly or that you are invincible right? I said no, she said not bipolar. I have never been diagnosed to this day, but the older I get the more I suspect it, and I know that there is more than one type of bipolar, and think she was very wrong to dismiss me. If she would have let me, I would have told her how I have times where I am convinced nothing bad will come of spending money that leaves me in financial ruin time and time again and I *know* its not normal. Or how I moved to a different country on a split second decision. Or how every tattoo I have ever had I have decided to get and gotten within 48 hours or less, with no foresight and usually regret after. At the start she was easy to talk to, and ended up helping me with my ADHD by giving me a referral to a doctor that specializes in only mental health, and they prescribed me meds that have vastly improved my quality of life. We did not focus on my past trauma at the beginning, its really hard for me to bring up and she would *never* ask me anything or suggest something from my life we should talk about *except* the ADHD. Which to me was a small facet of my life that was now being taken care of by the prescribing doctors (1 hour sessions, at the beginning there were 5 or 6 in the first 3 months and now they are once every 3 months). It got to the point of me just complaining about my problems from the week or my stresses about the upcoming week which was not really the reason I started going but it still helped. she would try and tie everything to the ADHD and I just let it go. I did not have the energy to find *another* therapist, I still figured wed get around to it eventually, and just knowing I had my weekly appointment coming up helped me get through a lot of the daily crap that would come up and Id have to deal with. After about 9 months or so of weekly sessions, she shocked me one day by telling me that she did not think she would be able to help me as I was too resistant to discussing the ADHD and that it was not worth the financial strain of the copay (which it was, I still paid $50 each session) to talk about my day to day problems. She said we should focus on an end date unless I was willing to put more work in to it. I said we still had not gotten around to *any* of what I told her I needed to deal with in my first session, and she said that she was not really qualified for the extent of my trauma but that we could try though she suggested I see multiple counselors *at the same time* and that was probably the only way Id be able to get the help I needed. Now, possibly the most overwhelming of my past trauma is abandonment related. Which she knew. In my brain there would never be an end to therapy. I was settling in to the idea of seeing her and every week until I moved or she retired. I was comfortable there, I felt safe with her and the routine, so when she said we should end things it brought it all back. I can truly see that moment as when the final dominos started to fall. I went from feeling to safe to desperate to be worthy. I agreed to whatever just so she would not end the sessions. The first thing she did was something that she told me was a new, exciting method to help patients stop disassociating and bring them in to the present. Was disassociating a problem, a little, but later found out what Id been describing to her is maladaptive daydreaming. She just decided it was disassociation because of the ADHD.The method was this: first you closed your eyes and sat very still and centered yourself. She would say feel your feet, feel your hands, feel your breath, etc. Basic meditation/grounding exercises you can get free on YouTube. Then you would open your eyes and for however long until she said stop you had to tell her exactly what you are feeling and noticing and thinking presently. You could not think or say I am really stressed. It had to be physical like, I see a clock on the wall. My leg itches. there is a book on the bookshelf with a red spine. Anytime you would veer off a little, she would stop you and make you do it right. I *hated* it. Every time Id make these complaints, she would tell me its supposed to be uncomfortable, that is how you know its working. The thing was, Id spend all week preparing to talk about something important. Id take notes on what I wanted to talk about. I remember a few times I brought in letters or journals from my past I wanted to discuss and wed NEVER get around to any of it because she would spend at least the first 30 minutes doing the damn exercises, and another 5 minutes every other session trying to convince me to join her ADHD group therapy sessions, *which were another $50 copay*, no matter how many times I said no. I started leaving feeling frustrated and sad that I had not gotten to discuss what was actually quite difficult for me to prepare to say. Perhaps because of the fact that every single session I showed up with heavy thoughts on my mind and every single session she would force us to begin with this stupid exercise, but she made me *so much worse*. Id been casually disassociating *forever*. She did not teach me any skills to process or cope with these things being on the surface. But now my anxiety is tied with my life, I cannot separate the two. Doing things like looking at a clock or noticing a book on a shelf gives me anxiety. I am constantly overwhelmed by that fear of impending doom whenever I try and focus on reality. The only way I can get some respite is if I can manage to zone out the rest of the world entirely, which includes my day to day. I went from functional to entirely non-functional. Therapy with her ended when I had decided to move, which went badly. I was going to move in with a friend across the country. In the weeks leading up to the move anytime I expressed my doubts or fear something would go wrong she would tell me to stop focusing on the worry and just let something good happen. Yea, well, friend showed up to drive back with me and was a major AH and went from being my absolute best friend I have ever had, still, to years later were still not speaking. And I had no skills to cope, and had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. These days I am not even a little okay. I am not bringing in enough to make ends meet. My car is my income and it needs repairs. I used to shower daily, now sometimes I cry because I want to shower so bad and cannot bring myself to do it. The depression makes it so hard to get out the door and work, and if I do not manage it then the depression gets worse. I signed up for cerebral tonight because I need help bad and my insurance does not cover it. My grandma is helping me pay for it for now which makes me feel awful but I cannot on my own. My first therapist appointment is Monday and I am so scared they are going to be like all the others and tell me they cannot help me. I am so alone and lost idk what Ill do if they cannot. My grandma is the only person I know within a 4 hour drive, and for reasons Id rather not go in to is not the best emotional support. If you made it to the end, thanks so much for listening. Remember you are not alone, and who you are is beautiful. I am starting therapy again after my last one was a horrible experience and I need to vent about it for a minute", "class": "Depression"}

Today I went to see him, he shuffled out into the paddock full of beans. He walked up to me for pats, then he sat down and did not get back up. Trying to touch him, and he would bite me. he is never in 9 years bitten me before, or shown any aggression to anything. Poor thing, so much pain. The vet came and euthanised him out in the grass where he lay. Spent 3 hours digging his grave.I delivered him by hand, watched over him as a puppy as if he was my son. I wish I was not so depressed that I could have visited him more. I feel like the worst person in the world for ignoring that big, dopey, lovable boy. So much regret for not taking him to the beach last summer, or the summer before. I wanted to and had everything prepared, but I just do not care about life anymore.I started 2020 the happiest I have ever been in my miserable life. For the first time in my life, I was happy. I was actually fit and healthy, had a girlfriend who was the first true love of my life, lots of true friends, respect at work in a winery. It felt like maybe life was worth living. Lockdown happened, and lost it all. When things opened back up, I pulled myself up by the bootstraps for a while. Physically recovered and got fit again, new girlfriend. Then December happened. Unfortunately lack of healthcare meant I had a back pain flair up that nearly crippled me, work got super busy and all my coworkers took their frustrations out on me( probably deserved, but still not nice), and I got ghosted again. I just gave up on life. The past 7 or 8 months have been truly nightmarish. cannot leave the house, cannot talk to anyone, cannot enjoy anything or feel much of anything. I just do not know how to keep going.Well okay, the past couple of months I have started leaving the house and hanging out with friends at least twice a month. But after today, I just completely give up again.Hope I can get through the next 12 hours so I can make a doctors appointment. I know it will take nearly a year before a mental healthcare professional is available. But maybe my doctor can help. let us hope I can speak on the phone and ask for any available doctor. I bet I will be so choked up with anxiety I cannot speak.I think I will be safe at least for tonight. My body is probably broken after digging the grave. I cannot move my legs, presumably my back and hips have been strained.I know the rules say I must request personal support for myself or others. I cannot feel anything good right now. This is the best I can do. I need help and I do not know how to ask. Sharing has been cathartic. Perhaps that is enough for tonight.R.I.P. Mister Vinny. My best friend. My dog died today.

{"id": "7207", "text": "IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, I am 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started \"real life\") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such. &amp;#x200B;In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I am at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there is no magic cure and its something I will have to live with. That being said, I do not side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I do not think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face. &amp;#x200B;At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you are good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I do not blame them for it because it should not be expected of them. I do not think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.&amp;#x200B;Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I do not really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases). &amp;#x200B;A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. \"Institutions\" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off. &amp;#x200B;Conditions like Aspergers are not much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies do not naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with \"disabilities\" or doing something else of little respect. I am actually personally looking into doing sex work.&amp;#x200B;I certainly do not see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I am not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just does not work. I will say that one benefit (there are not many) is I do think I am a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there is no shame in what they are doing. I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "15238", "text": "I am a 21 years old female and I have moved back to one of my parents 2 months ago after finishing 6 years of psychotherapy (impatient). My main diagnosis is borderline personality disorder, but I have been diagnosed with depression as a teenager, and I believe it has returned since I have come home (so these two are comorbid now). The point is that I feel exhausted all the time. I can barely do any chores which makes me feel bad as I am unemployed (looking for work) so I cannot contribute financially either. Whenever I have the energy I always do something, but it is pretty rare. For example, now it is early in the afternoon here and I have literally just had a bath and feel like I have run 10K without any food. The reality is that I had oatmeal with berries a few hours before that and I had been in bed on my computer, so *I should have the energy.* The whole thing is even worse because I have PCOS and insulin resistance and I am about 20kgs overweight. My eating is actually quite good now but I know I should really get moving as well. I actually feel like cycling, doing yoga, body weight exercises etc. fairly often but I just do not seem to have the energy (I used to work out all the time when I was anorexic, 6 days a week, often 2 times a day). Sometimes I can barely hold my phone while mindlessly scrolling in bed. My limbs all feel weak and wasted away. I have no idea if this can be caused solely by depression or what, as this is pretty extreme I am going to. Even after spending almost all day in bed (maybe a 6K walk every second day) I can sleep up to 11 hours a day. In the past, I was unable to sleep more than 8 hours at one go. Btw I do not use any stimulants, do not drink coffee/ caffeinated tea, alcohol etc. because they worsen my anxiety. However, I usually fail to drink enough water, which I know is not useful.

Just driving to work everyday hoping Ill have a head-on collision with a semi, that way maybe it will take some of the grief away from sister thinking it was accidental, and also because I am too much of a coward to actually kill myself. I mean, obviously as a teen with a drug addict mom, the deck was stacked against me. Add-on being bullied all throughout school for being gay and having absolutely no self worth from it to this day. I should seek refuge in my own community right? I am not 160 pounds, do not have a six pack, and not fully white so they could not care less about my circumstances. I have tried the therapy and pills thing and I love getting to sacrifice any and all emotion just to not feel the negative ones. I do not even get sad anymore. I just feel bitter and angry. I genuinely see other people thriving and it makes me hope something terrible happens to them that ruins their life. Why should they get to be happy but I do not? Why is it fair?

{"id": "16995", "text": "I used to be a brat in middle school, only wanting to play games and run around. My grades were terrible, and I was always a sidekick, looking for the popular kids to accept me. One day that changed. I was in chemistry class, we were learning about atoms and I became very intrigued and it suddenly snapped. I was no longer that brat, I became more reserved, felt more conscious and aware of things, heck I never studied, but went on to graduate high school on top of my class. I was no longer the same person. I was very ambitious in high school. I wanted to be a scientist or an engineer, work for NASA and be a part of all those amazing projects. As I progressed through high school however, my life slowly started going downhill, and I became very depressed and suicidal.I have aphantasia so I cannot really imagine anything, so some things are a lot harder for me when it comes to studies. However, that is not the reason my life was ruined, in fact I did not really care much about that.I never had any real friends, I have general anxiety, puberty fucked me in the ass, I realized life is not fair and so on. I mean, can you imagine how hard it is for a high schooler, at the peak of his youth, to get back hair, hyperhidrosis and a bunch of other things. I was always made fun of for having excessive body hair, I did not mind it much, but back hair is a new beast entirely. Every other dream I have I feel exposed, anxious, I can almost hear everyone making fun of me and casting me out. I suppose this stole my youth and that is where I got very existential. We are not born equal, we only die equally, I told myself. If there is no God, and life is all about randomness, then I drew an awful straw and wasted my one shot at life, If there is a God, then why did he do this to me? I quickly became an absurdist, and then a cynical nihilist. Depression tore me apart, every night I would think about suicide. However, I was still hopeful, I studied for the university entrance exam daily, failed my first choice spectacularly and then realized how choices mattered. If I woke up earlier and studied in middle school, got into a better high school that was math heavy, I would have passed. Anyway, I failed another exam, and finally got accepted to study physics. I loved physics, so I thought why not? Although my first 2 fails really shattered my confidence. I started out okay, but I felt like the odd one out in my class, mainly because my end goal was suicide, and In this room there were many with great ambitions. I could not focus on classes because of this anxiety, but I still went to lectures. I was dying already and not even a semester had passed. The work load was too much, and my only goal was suicide. Because of the obvious lack of motivation, I dropped out, and my parents subjected me to mental torture in the coming months. I have an awful sleep schedule, and go to bed at 10 am, not because I am on my phone, or something, but because I am overthinking and despairing too much to fall asleep.Nowadays I am a shut-in neet, just waiting for an opportunity to die. I have some thoughts of just changing, forgetting about everything, getting a job, living a different life than the life I have always wanted, but I do not see myself overcoming this, I guess a big part of me just does not want to. If I did not have empathy, I would have killed myself ages ago. Thanks for reading this long and boring post. From a life of ambition to a dead end", "class": "Depression"}

My family convinced me to move closer them and it has helped get me out of the fog tremendously. I decided to go back to therapy and I started doing activities that I like and exercising, hanging with friends and family and I have gotten a lot better where I feel super motivated, positive, and like the possibilities for my life are endless. I have always been a bubbly energetic person so depression really hit me hard and since getting better I have just told myself I never want to feel like that again.It was just another normal day and idk why but all of a sudden it felt like my heart sank and I felt that hopeless depressed feeling like when I was at my lowest. It was so random. And I am sorry I do not want to minimize depression at all like that since I am not that aware of others experience. I just know that was the worst I ever felt in my life but I know that I barely dipped my toes in it as I know others go through it much worse. I actively tried to do something to snap out of it and eventually I did but I just thought it was so weird. It felt like how I felt before but someone elses feelings because it hit me so randomly.

{"id": "8125", "text": "Hey you all.I am a 38 year old male, married with an 8 year old and a 8 month old. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years now. I was passively suicidal about 3-4 years ago, but that feeling has since dropped of dramatically with proper medication, therapy, and leaving a life situation behind that I really struggled with.What I am really struggling with feeling alone and without people that care lately, outside of my own four walls.Growing up, I had a very close family on my mom's side. I have 2 brothers, 4 aunt's/uncle's and many cousins from those. We used to get together every Sunday and all major holidays.My mom passed away back in 2008 and nothing family had been the same since, especially for me. My mom was amazing - she was my biggest cheerleader, my confidant, and talked me off every ledge. After she died, My dad moved about 14 hours away. One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence, to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed, and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away, or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby, because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though, and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned, my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend, and we are super close. About a month ago though, he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life, but I was devastated.On the friends front, I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends, but none that I see or hang out with often - except one - and about 5-6 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time, I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes, I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community, but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90% of the congregation. Tldr - I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me, cut me out of their lives, or died. I am really struggling with relationships, and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die - whether self inflicted or not - who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls, and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for, and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there, and that makes me sad.

My childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and I was neglected for a long time. The older I get I can see how this stuff has messed with me and how its always been messing with me and the way I socialize with people. I met my dad when I was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he did not want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. I never wanted to have kids and I was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and I believed her and now she is pregnant and I am almost certain that its my daughter. She was born in April I think. I do not know her name or where she is. My ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she will not communicate with me at all. So that is what is been going on in my life. Then I met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and I really liked her a lot too. But all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. When someone says something good to me I cannot believe its true for some reason and I feel like things are going to get real bad. This girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. We were going out and having a real good time and then I did not hear from her one day and I got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. I feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but I was real nervous and did not want to wait around for her to open my snap so I text her and told her how I felt and that I hope she was not ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. She text back and was sorry but I said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. This went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. So these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. Anyways I feel like that was too overwhelming for me and I told her how I felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it would not work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew I was attached and she was too but she was afraid it would not work out and that she could not be what I wanted right now. I feel so stupid and I feel like I ruined things. I think I have jus got so much going on these days its already hard for me to function as it is and I was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and I hate myself. I embarrassed myself so bad and ruined something that could have been great.", "class": "Depression"}

They end up isolated by almost everyone who is their age and does not even understand why. It does not even stop after one is young either or when you graduate HS. kids like this or (\"us\" I guess) grow up to be the guy in college who only stays in the dorm 24/7 or goes straight from work to home every single day of the week. and girls who grow up like this will not end up like this so much, but will keep getting in one relationship after another, where the guy only wants one thing from her and basically every time she finds out the guy was just using her for sex or validation. And of course this vicious cycle leads many women to think all men are bad when they just keep meeting other people who are mentally ill (but not in the same way maybe her brother who grew up the same would be)Hope you guys found understanding in this post or related to it well I feel like we as a country (the US) do not do nuance and mentally ill people suffer for that", "class": "Depression"}

I have a traumatic childhood, history of abusive relationships, a pedophilic experience, self harm abuse etc and no one thought to check in on me?

I have no identity. No one cares to know who I am, and in turn, never gave myself a chance to know eitherOne more rejection will be the final nail in the coffin, I am so mentally unstable that it will make or break me, and I am scared for the latter.I wish I could tell my friends and family how I feel but I could not bear to be even more of a burden to them than I already am.Sorry if you have been unfortunate enough to find this post, I just needed some sort of message out there to the universe and see if it has anything positive to reply with Born to please others, will death be the only true selfish action I perform on myself?", "class": "Suicidal"}

Although that is not a long time, we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment, he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating, he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020, a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it - he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year (which did not help). Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met, he was having a \"good phase\", but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good, others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself, so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him, we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me, which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide, is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and never-ending waves of corona.(These are just a few of his reasons)I know I cannot \"fix\" his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him, but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him, even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively (besides just being supportive, listening, being there for him,...)If anyone has read this far, thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good advice(English is not my first language- so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing) I (W/18) am scared of my boyfriend (M/20) committing su*cide", "class": "Depression"}

I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine.

{"id": "16115", "text": "I think that is the quote at least, correct me if I am wrong but its been sticking with me for the past few days. My depression started 9 years ago when I was being bullied by my school staff. On the surface it does not sound bad but the treatment I went through genuinely has left a permanent scar on me, just because of the emotional turmoil it put me through as such a young age. I saw this quote twice in the same day and it just kept sticking with me and I realized it was true. I do not feel like I have emotionally matured past that point. I was so young when it happened and I have been stuck for the past 9 years. I still throw tantrums. My fear of being alone. My naivete. Even my methods of self harm are childish. I still FEEL like a child. I literally feel and process my emotions like a child does. I do not know how to even move past this trauma and I do not think I will. My emotional state, including the depression and everything it brought with it, has not changed in 9 years. Maybe things feel like they are getting worse because I am dealing with bigger problems than I have been able to Emotionally handle. The older i get the more I am biting off more than I can chew because 8 year old problems are alot different from almost 17 year old problems.

{"id": "18323", "text": "I am going to be turning 30 in a couple weeks.I am a white dude from Washington State and I grew up playing a lot of video games (n64, etc)I never did well in school because I never spent any time studying, my mother watched 6 kids (2 cousins, 3 siblings and then myself) so she was too busy to make sure I was getting assignments turned in. My dad worked full time manual labor and he was always too tired when he got home and I never wanted to bother him on his days off.Fast forward to Sophomore high school, my dad gets non-Hodgkin lymphoma and deteriorates rapidly. He passes a little after my 16th birthday. I end up dropping out and working part time jobs.I was dating a girl who still to this day I feel like in a universe or reality that I was not shit, I would have ended up with her. I still talk to her sometimes and she is awesome, but she has her own life now.Anyway, she ended up leaving around the same time my dad passed away so between working (first job was at GameStop, and yeah it was fucking awful) I would spend most of my time in my room listening to Postal Service and crying.I tried to get back into school, ended up taking some community college classes. Dropped out, came back, dropped out etc I am not sure how many times between the ages of 18 to 21. When I was 22 I started dating again, and the first girl I slept with I ended up getting pregnant. I was always taught do not have sex because it will make Jesus cry and I kind of did not really give a fuck about that. What should have been said was it will kill your youth and leave you an empty broken person or at least, that is how it was for me.We talked and decided she should have the baby and she came to live with me at my moms house (what a catch I am right) and I supported her through her awful pregnancy (lots of morning sickness, etc)I end up getting a job at Safeway and a friend teaches me how to drive and loans me enough to buy a shitty car that lasted me about 2 years.So by this point I am 25ish and we move in with our son to a new apartment. I am actually in school and doing well this time and she is working as a bartender. I finish school by the time I am 27 and graduate with an associates in paralegal studies.Just about right after I find a new job using my degree She stops working. I bugged her about working or going to school constantly because I felt like you should always be striving to improve? Or something. Just sitting at home while I am working is kind of shit because the entire time we were together I was either working or in school.During this time in our wonderful life together, she brings home an older Korean gentleman and fucks him on our bed. We had an argument over her not doing anything and she went to the bar she used to work at and decided that is the best thing for her to do I guess.We worked through that. I had this idea of having a nice family and I made so many decisions because of this. The year before the pandemic I tell her that I am going back to school to get a bachelors because I do not earn enough for us to live with just me working. So that means we will have to move back in with my mom which She did not like. I was kind of in the tough shit mood because I was doing all the heavy lifting. Right before I started going to class my grandmother passed away and left me a bit of money. I always wanted to go to Japan and so did She (my then fianc) so we took a few week trip and it was fun.So about a year into me going to school she has a meltdown and tells me that I do not give her enough affection (which, she could have been right) but my idea of affection was providing. I always told her I did not care what she did after I graduated, but until then she should at least contribute.She ends up leaving and moving in with her friends. Then from there She ends up meeting a girl and becomes the third person in that relationship. She leaves me to take care of our son. she would rather be getting fucked by two people than even attempting to be a good mom to him. I mean she was never a great mother, but kids do not really understand that. I have long since had the mom is not coming home talk with my son but he still says stuff like when mom comes back etc and it kills me.So for about the past few months I have been living in this pure agony. She will call him every day or so, but I want absolutely nothing to do with her. I feel like if there was not a child involved it would be a clean easy breakup. I have dealt with breakups before. The idea that I am chained to this woman through him is so fucking aggravating. She texted me saying she was going to come pick him up and have him stay the night with her (she lives an hour+ away) I said the fuck you are, as long as I have known her she spends most of the day getting high and I know she is living with people who grow their own weed. So yea, fuck that. Also she cannot drive and I do not want this lady I do not know driving this kid around.I obviously care a lot for my Son, but I have realized just how meaningless everything truly is. I wish I would have made better decisions, maybe not had a child with a psychopath.I am an average looking dude who had horrible acne and still does and I have realized that when I get acne it always leaves a scar on my body. The ones on my face I do not touch, but the ones on my body will pop just from sleeping and those always leave nice bright pink scar tissue.I am down about 35 pounds since April. I was 220 and last I weighed myself out of the shower I was 185. I have not been eating or sleeping much. Before this I never did drugs but I have been spending just about every moment not with my son (my mom has been helping me and she is wonderful) getting cross faded and screaming into pillows or crying. I used to have horrible anxiety but ever since I started actively wishing I was dead I have not had panic attacks.I do not want to work again. I do not want to go back to School in the fall. I do not want to start dating again, but I would have liked real help raising him. I feel so guilty bringing a child into this shitty fucked up world. The only thing stringing me along is the thought of what my son will have to go through when I am gone. Id like my mother to take care of him and not his drug addled mother.Ultimately I feel like I wasted my entire life. I know success can be measured in different ways but what do I really have? I have no friends. I am in an insane amount of debt and my body is falling apart. I am starting to lose my hair and I cannot grow a beard due to genetics. The only thing Id be willing to accept is a reset button. I believe that when you die that is it just lights out and that sounds so much better than what I am feeling daily.I know where this is heading. I cannot afford to keep going to school now that she is gone because I exhausted everything I had because I thought someday she would give a fuck and start working but yea that never happened.Id rather be dead than work in a grocery store for minimum wage while single handedly raising my kid. I know he will miss me when I am gone, but all this shit is meaningless anyway. The Universe will have its heat death and that will be itIm sorry if anyone actually read all this. I should have made better choices. I do not want to get help, I do not want to get better. The bottom line is I need to go back in time. Anything other than that means nothing to me. I am not going to be killing it in my mid to late 30s, its fucking over for me.On my 30th birthday I am going to go to a bar with my full bottle of Trazadone, drink a shit ton and then down the pills in the bathroom.

I can feel ever little piece of my mind like my cells degenerating over time. My spirit is on fire, but not of passion but of terror &amp; torment. I try to run from myself; distract myself with projects and errands. Things that make me feel \"useful\", to make me feel like I am \"accomplishing my goals\". But the truth is I am going in circles. No matter how much I accomplish I find my self broke, in debt, in disgrace, in shame.The truth is I am stuck, and my feet are in quicksand. And when the fear shoots up, I try to resist &amp; fight it, but it pulls into it further. I am 27 years old and I am going nowhere fast. I am failing, I am failing in life. I am failing myself. I fail everyday, it is the illusion of progress.People tell you shit like \"you are learning\" or \"you are growing\", but the truth is that is the last thing I am doing. I am just coming up short, failing. Finding new ways to disappoint myself.I live a quiet life of desperation and it kills me. I try praying, scratching, clawing to get a modicum of \"air\", of life. But I come up short every time.I am not living, I am not even existing at this point, I am just suffering for the sake of suffering, and the worst part is I cannot let go of the part that is trying to give it all greater meaning. I am tired of being here, yes I might get out of this funk, but I will be back here again like I always do, and that is the problem; nothing REALLY changes.I am tired of fighting to live for a life that is kills me everyday.I would rather fadeaway then burn out.

Even before the pandemic things were bad in terms of meeting people but now it is even worse. it is almost and probably is, impossible.The city I live in is unique in terms of it as a high turnover rate therefore incidences of meeting people, specifically bad people, is higher than normal cities. But nevertheless, the same trials and tribulations go on anywhere. But being said, everything in this post is tailored to the city that I live in.But what happened? It is so difficult to meet anybody anymore. Older women, like women my age, they are broken, bruised, jaded, and fed up because they are approached by pieces of garbage constantly. he is gotten to the point where I cannot even make eye contact with a woman when I am walking past her on a sidewalk. They literally look down or look away because they are tired of being approached. Also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. Then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city, and again, it is impossible. Within this gigantic sea of terrible men, there are few Good Men drowning, not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time, energy, good souls, and the possibility of memorable love. I am tired of fighting through the walls being built by women and forged by pieces of garbage men. I am fed up, and it makes me enormously depressed.I never had a problem dating in this city in the past, but now I cannot get a foot in the door, a word in edgewise and I know it is not me. Even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. Most of the women that are younger, they want money. They want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.Then you have a lot of left-leaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. Since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? In the worst of it is, the vaccine. If you did not get a vaccine, you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. And I thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. What do I know.What I do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely. I am a good guy, dedicated, intelligent, talented. Every single night after the sun sets, reality sets into how lonely I really feel. And there is this dark hope inside of me saying there is somebody out there but I really do not think so.We dug our own holes here. we have become so selective, so judgmental, some materialistic, so single-minded, our eyes are not open, and we push people away. we would rather be alone because we are afraid to catch a virus. we would rather be alone because we do not want to deal with the possibility of somebody losing their job and becoming dependent on the other. we would rather be alone because it is easier to lump everybody into a category that supports a divide that is country wide.Where I agree with most of that, and I am an introvert, so I understand being alone, but damn do I want to hold somebody is hand. the state of dating...", "class": "Depression"}

Something that can help me learn how to be in more control in how I respond to daily life, criticism, uncomfortable or threatening scenarios, and just general positive and/or negative conversations.About me: I am someone who has been clinically diagnosed with PTSD with Anxiety attacks, depression, and general anxiety. I was raised in an emotionally and physically abusive home and suffered throughout life as a kid. Honestly, it felt like i was bullied and abused most of my life. Since becoming an adult and I am more self aware and I really want to turn things around! After being clinically diagnosed, I decided to pursue therapy. I was in therapy for a couple years but I ended up losing the privilege of having access to therapy due to insurance and being broke. I really do not want to take medication but its getting to the point that idc anymore and i just want to be drugged up. I really really hate how much I struggle with my mental health and I want to have this bitch in check and not let my surroundings or other ppl in my head. At one point in my life, before covid, I felt like I had (most of) it under control. Sure, I had my bad days still but nothing like before. With the pandemic, i feel my mental health has gradually gotten worse again. I freak out with certain triggers, i get scared of what ppl think or say of me, and its even harder when it feels the worlds against me when receiving harsh criticism. (Ex: my mother says things like: this is why bad shit happens to you or now i understand why you got abused) After I calm down from my panic attacks, I always feel so defeated and even worse. I end up isolating myself and just crying the rest of the day and laying in bed until the next day because I cannot stop replaying my life history. I WANT THAT TO STOP. I just want to learn how to stop letting things get to me. Basically learn to be careless or not care for all the right reasons. Sorry if my post is all over the place.

{"id": "11202", "text": "Sorry about the title, just wanted to grab attention I am slowly recovering from depression after so many years of suffering from it. I was in such a dark phase and since I was able to come out of it, I just want to say this to you all (to whoever suffering from a lot of things in life) : I may not understand what you are going through but there is definitely light in the end of the tunnel, provided you are willing to reach there by putting efforts. I believe we all need the push we require to excel what we are capable of in life. there is definitely hope, no matter what situation you are trapped in. I know when you are depressed, you tend to be way too hard on yourself. I have felt hopelessness for the longest time in life and eventually I got way too comfortable in feeling that way and failed to get out of the hell, which indeed ruined my life further. So, please start reflecting on yourself from a different perspective and you will definitely find a way to deal with any situation by nurturing yourself. Talk to someone who would help you get out of whatever situation. Yes, we all need validation and we seek to find people who would say comforting words and it is necessary but not every single time. Sometimes, you need people who would push you to do your best by being honest with you. Never start to pity yourself then you will eventually get too comfortable being that way and it will be very hard to get out of it. Be compassionate with yourself by knowing how you could improve certian attributes to enhance your performance in life and start taking small steps. Remember, to take only small steps in the beginning because since we are depressed, we may easily find the job overwhelming if we set difficult short term goals. Trust me on this because I have been there and have ruined my life enough. there is ALWAYS HOPE!!! START TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF!! Exercising helps a lott!!!!!!

This just really needed to come out of me. |||Distrust, disappointment and futile attempts to escape hackdom is all life seems to be.||| 29 years old. I make money as a commercial music producer - music for ads, tv and sometimes amateur film. I am really starting to hate my job. I feel like I am lying to myself when I do it. My family are somewhat encouraging but I know they think I am a fuck up. I spend every bit of time (when I am not trying to calm down my anxiety or pull myself out of depression and when I do not need to crawl out of bouts of procrastination) on music \\- playing it, recording it, composing it, listening to it, reading about it. I have always wanted to be able to live off of my own art - but I have always told myself since the beginning (13) that this is a dreamers pursuit and to be realistic - to see what life is really like - and to know that this obsession will lead to nothing but suffering, alienation and potentially a whole lot of humiliation...but.... to do it anyway - because in the meaninglessness of life you should try to at least make it all about what you love. As I get older the idea of getting somewhere... and by somewhere I do not mean for fame or fortune.... but to make something people care about, to do something important in a way of giving back to culture - giving back to the arts that have not only saved my life numerous times, but made me feel exhilaration and love like nothing else has.... this idea of getting somewhere feels less and less likely. The most depressing part is that I do not think I have even properly put myself out there yet, that I would not really know how to --- That I move in so many different directions artistically, that I am so indecisive with what I want that it kind of seems impossible.... AND that this feeling of age is looming on the horizon. Like I am crossing over to 30, with my chances of any of this happening slipping away.Drugs and alcohol have now officially become about coping for me. it is not a party anymore. I hate socialising most of the time, I do not have social problems I am just really tired of it - especially when it is not music related - so I act up, get sarcastic and facetious and use the booze and amphetamines as a way around being irritated by everything and everyone. Which I feel guilty about... ...Because I know this is clearly just me being a miserable, selfish asshole. I cannot stand the incessant opinions of others - I never react to what is being said, I can even ignore it at the time but when I hear some of the shit that comes out of peoples mouths there is always a pain in me that starts and becomes more and more intense over a few hours. It turns into resentment, hate and then crushing sadness. The arrogance, meanness and the seemingly endless conjecture I keep hearing from everyone around me is excruciatingly distressing. I socialise less and less because of this. I live with a few older men - who all at one point tried to do what I want to do. It has not worked out. Now all they seem to have is marijuana, welfare cheques and a cynicism that is so dry, dull and invasive that just by proximity It can make you feel overwhelmingly despondent, dehydrated, hateful and high. there is a bitterness in them that you can feel through the walls of the house. Avoiding conversation is imperative if you want to maintain sanity with these types. Speaking with angry contrarians has never been helpful for mental wellbeing. At least not for me anyway. I have been through 3 long term relationships that all ended badly. The last one was particularly bad. I blame my apathy. Right now I am sort of in a casual relationship with someone who I suspect sees me as an ignorant pig. there is a lot of criticism about a lot of different things thrown in my face by her. Any conversation I bring up about commitment or what the relationship itself is meant to be is dodged. I am really starting to feel like I cannot trust this person. That they see me as disposable. I have already uncovered a few lies by them. Maybe I am wasting my time with a lot of people in my life. Maybe they are wasting their time with me. Every once in a while when I drink I think about killing myself. Every once in a while when I am sober I do as well. Some months way more frequently than others. Some days in those months it is for hours at a time. A few months back, I grabbed some stainless steel scissors and started cutting into my forearm. No one found out what the scars really came from. I had a bad excuse. I am still not sure if it was Just to feel something or to express my frustration in some way. Maybe it was for attention. Cutting myself for attention makes me feel an incredible amount of shame to just think about. But like I say I am not exactly sure why. I do not know where this is going, but I feel like I needed to put this down somewhere.. I have tried a shrink, I have tried family and friends. It seems to only be met with fear. I am sorry again.

A switch just flipped my head and I no longer want to bother with living.My depression has gotten worse, from bi-monthly episodes to several times a week.

Literally the only thing keeping me going on at this point are the student loans I have to pay off. I do not want my family stuck with the bill, so after a few more months of work, I am paying them off in bulk, then I am done.I do not know if this is due to some other underlying condition, like an organ failure that is messing with my head, but honestly I do not care.

{"id": "10665", "text": "30 days from now I will be 16. It feels surreal to be honest. My entire life up to this point has just been a disappointing miserable mush of trauma and the desire to let it end already. In all honesty its been like this all my life. For almost as long as I can remember, slowly becoming more and more obvious as time went on. Life does not feel real, just a lump of memories, few good, mostly bad and a dream like feeling. Like there is not someone in there, just a she will of what a human ought to be. One of my first memories is being six and looking in the mirror and hating how I did not \"look and act like a person\" and comparing myself to my classmates. They looked like people. They acted like people. I did not feel like one. It terrified me back then that I was going to be an adult, probably because of how different a child and an adults responsibilities were. I remember being nine, and being petrified that I was halfway to becoming an adult. I want to go back to that state. I am scared. Scared of turning 18. When I was 12 and the awful became worse I promised myself I would kill myself at 16 if things did not get better. Shortly after that I changed it to 18, maybe its because that back part of my brain was a coward, but I convinced my self it was because my family would have to see my body. My disgusting ugly self with an equally atrocious brain. And here I am, almost approaching the age that has scared me all my life. 760 days until I am 18. I truly do not ever think I will escape this depressing mindset I locked myself into so young. I am empty, I am emotionally drained and ready to go missing for weeks before my body is finally discovered decaying in some forest. I do not know how I will die. I do not know if ill be able to kill myself on the exact day I turn 18. Not that it would matter. Nobody would care if I died. My parents certainly would not, they are the ones who watered this miserable seed of,,whatever this is in my head. They do not even leave their rooms anymore. Not that I care. Being around them any longer then humanly necessarily would just make me feel worse. My life honestly feels so wasted. I can barely eat something without feeling like I am going to vomit. Its this constant sense of nausea. Why did I have to be born into this body? Why this brain? Why do I feel like I am watching a car crash behind a foggy windshield everyday? what is wrong with me? Can a truck just crash threw my house and kill me lol. I wish I did not get up when I tripped that one time while I crossed the street when I was younger. Face smashed in with no chance of living, and I get seen as this tragic death of a young girl and my parents and classmates might have actually pretended to like me for a week or two. Oh well.Sorry for this, I do not know why my brain is being so bad in particular. Maybe its the insomnia talking. Most days I can suck it up and just keep it in my head, or write a little two paragraph vent that scratches the surface of my stupid idiotic thoughts.

Its been very stressful but since i finished school I have been super depressed because of the fact that I am always tired and wasting time. The things i wanted to do and the passions i had for all of my hobbies dissapeared.Due to this I have been seeing myself as worthless and a failure of a human being. I cannot count how many times I have been crying during the night when my family is sleeping, thinking about how I am not doing the things i want to do let alone being productive in my life.All that I am doing is mindlessly stare at my computer screen for hours and go on very long periods of maladaptive daydreams where I am acknowledged for my imaginary accomplishments and competence. Everytime i watch anime or a movie where the main character does something cool or whatever and gets praised, i often start daydreaming and putting myself in that scenario as that character and endulge myself in the imaginary praise, recognition and approval from others. As if something is lacking in my life that leads me into maladaptive daydreaming.As soon as i realize that I am not the person I am daydreaming about i start contemplating about my life which ultimately ends me in a depressive state.I hate being tired all the time i hate being depressed and i hate this anxiety that is killing me from the inside out. I hate being with people knowing my life are not worth shit and i hate trying to explain to other people that i literally cannot do anything because of this fatigue while being a slave to my own mind.

I have always been good at acting happy, smiling and laughing with friends and family but as soon as I am alone i start living in reality and seeing my life for what it is.I really want to help myself since i still have my hopes and dreams but with this fatigue i cannot help but wonder if I am just going to waste my life away in my own mind, dreaming about being the man i want to be.This post is just me venting the frustration I am stuck and there is no end in sight", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "9813", "text": "how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now. Whether my problems lays in being unable to accept my mediocrity, pure laziness or something deeper.. I am asking for your insight please, oh kind people of reddit.

And I cannot completely express myself, so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig, I not sure.I am introvert, antisocial, athiest , logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage , you know , so that they feel it ig , that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday , shouting and wasting your time , just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like , I cannot do anything now , I do not care , I will just move on, but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that, why did not I say that and get depressed everytime.

And so I have realized that that is the core problem. If someone could give me real reasons to get better maybe I would be willing to try again.

When I was younger, I chose sides with my father since he was a little less strict. Because of that my mother holds a lot of hatred against me. She insulted me since I was 5 when my father was not around. And in the past 2 years ever since Covid started, She started taking Work From Home. My mother and I never got along well, mostly because I am a tomboy and my she bought a lot of tricks and girly dresses and a very few t-shirts. So, I tend to only wear the t-shirts, but my neighbour's kid who is a girl loves girly stuff, so most of the time my mother wishes I was not her daughter. And also as I earlier stated that she hated me and the reason for that. As my mother started insulting me about that I am dumb since I am a girl etc. I went kind of crazy. Until one day I could not take it anymore and screamed. I know that was bad of me but I could not control myself this time. And to top things off, my brother behaves like a literal baby, even though he is not one. Which usually gets me into trouble. And fun fact, if my brother does the same mistake as me, my mother is more kind to him compared to me. And I currently have a bad relationship with my father and I do not have anyone who I can go to. And I think my mother has a weird obsession if making me look bad in front of people by telling them my day to day mistakes. But no one's perfect. My mental state has gone to the thought of me killing myself, I have tried to but my dreams get in the way. I like singing so when I mentioned earlier that I screamed, it was pretty loud since my voice went high because I have been practicing a few songs. Now a days, I do not like interacting with many people, I only opened up to 2 people in this lifetime and neither of my parents are included in the list of those 2 people.

{"id": "11537", "text": "The title is not meant to discourage others, but it is what I feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. I just want to get some stuff of my chest, even though it will not help for long. What better place to do it- than *Reddit*? I do not know, but I will still do it. I do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help, so this is again more for me to unload. However there is a possibility someone can help- so it does not hurt. I also rarely write large amounts of texts like this, so I am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order- randomness- etc.. from this text.This is also going to be really long, as I will include many things- both as background and as reason.If you struggle with things yourself, please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. I feel terrible when I see others struggle and I wish I could help them. **let us start with a little about me:**My first name is Adrian- the rest will remain anon. I am just about to turn 24 years old, live in Norway and have a stable full time job. I have an apartment, a car and money is not an issue.When most people hear that, they think I have life perfectly under control- that I am more lucky than others. And- to a degree that is true. I have been more lucky than many people in this world- but it is not what I have in my possession that brings me happiness. What brings me down is my social anxiety- combined with depression. I have a *somewhat different* type of social anxiety, but I was still diagnosed with it. I can be in crowds, be it in malls or shopping centers- stores- whatever it might be without an issue. Talking to strangers is not an issue, unless it is random chatting. By that I mean, if I am to pay for what I am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar I have no issues at all. I think that is because I know what to say, how to respond and all that- it is all been done before enough times where I am comfortable doing it. When it comes to random chat however... it is tough to even do with my family. Primarily because I have nothing to talk about. When I am at work, and my colleagues are having a chat- I never join in because I have no clue how to participate. Even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. While I sit there, trying to think of *something* interesting I can mention- but I am completely blank. When I do however get asked about something I do know, it is quite alright- until I make some sort of mistake (like stating a fact, that turned out to be false) I feel like an idiot. I do not show that though- I shrug it off and pretend I found it sort of funny. I live most of my life currently pretending I am happy, like everything is fine. I work at a place I cannot show my depression to others. I imagine most places would be like that however. I am quite good at that now, do not think most people know my life is... bad. **let us go back in time a bit:**Quite early in my life, after changing schools because of moving- I was starting to become a target from bullies. The good old classic. Some people would constantly pick on me, other people pretended to be disgusted when I was nearby- some just ignored me and so on. The school's solution to this was to remove me from class... I thought back then that was great, get me away from those people. I have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. I never got to work with other students, never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. I was alone, with a teacher of my own. I did have a few friends, so that was something- but long story short I messed that up and lost them.This went on until the end of 10th grade. Get bullied, picked on- and have a few nice people that I would stick with until something happened that made them go away. Then high school arrived- and I was excited for a new chance with new people. (and of course I liked the school.) The first few months, I attended school but gained no contacts. No one treated me bad so I did not really mind that.. Until one day where I entered my classroom, 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when I passed them. Thinking back at it now, I think it was just a coincidence- but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls I even found attractive, so that did not help. Then after a little more time things become quite good. I became friends with a few in class, and the rest still treated me quite alright. The only thing that made me feel bad was the thought I still had not had a girlfriend. (This was at the age of 16, quite early to sob about such a thing.). Year 2 of high school, I went the route for car mechanics. I was back at the start of having no contacts, friends or such. I was still treated alright by everyone though. I asked some people if I could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch (some were over 18)- and they said I would be able to join them- it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. I felt neutral about that, because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. Later that year I made friends again. Great right? Indeed it was, school was fun again. (Fun fact, one of the people in this group was the girl I earlier stated I found attractive.) The only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. She was now a friend- and I did not want to ruin that. So despise people saying she was interested in me I took no chances. So I treated her as a friend, until near Christmas where I finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. That was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. I was back at the bottom, but pretended to be happy. Back then I was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why I was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so I walked away. She, and the others though did remain my friends out that year. School year ended, and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy- passive aggressive. So I gave up on them too. I did however remain friends with said girls- boyfriend. Next year, I retake the same year but with another subject. Same procedure, sit alone most of the time at first- then I make 2 friends. We shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. I believe these 2 were the best friends I had made. There is of course a girl in class I found attractive- and she had a difficult personality to understand... I misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. That of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. At this time, I do believe my main because of depression was things like this. The year ends, and I have to find a job- but I fail. I think I got 1 singular interview during the summer. They did not want me there so I was without a job. Here is where I got lucky, a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. I get there, and see the \"attractive girl from last school year\" was also called in for an interview. At this point I do however realize I am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. (At least that is what I believe). Both of us get the job (as apprentices), so there is that. During the next 2 years nothing interesting happens, except me constantly feeling horrible about life- and not having a single good experience on apps like Tinder and so on. Before I continue, let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. By the time I had reached 18, my depression was quite strong. I did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. While using the apps, I was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. That did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. I never dared to say hi to anyone- so that is my fault I guess. Those who said hi to me first- made me feel good! For about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. (Like the saying, talking to a wall.)These apps, did bring me even further down overall. Never up. Back to the real life part. &amp;#x200B;After 2 years you take sort of an exam, and after that you are no longer an apprentice. I scored maximum. (3 points, excellent.) So did the girl I was working with. One of the people I worked with suggested I invited the girl out for a \"celebratory\" dinner for finishing school 100% with a good score. It was worth a shot. She denied that immediately. (This did, once again- destroy me inside, but in the long run it was for the better.) Both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. That it did. We both remained colleagues so that is when I realized it was indeed good she said no. About at this time though, I make a incredibly stupid decision to \"reset my social life\". I thought if I could get myself into a completely new social environment I would maybe have a better life in general. I did this because I was still constantly feeling horrible- like people disliked me and such. After this I never made new friends, and 3- soon 4 years later here I am- still alone. I have never found another opportunity even to make new friends, I no longer meet new people. The people I meet at work are a lot older (no offence to them). And those my age still seem to look down on me. That is the big thing with me, I feel like everyone looks down on me- even without proof. The thing is, with social anxiety- is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. Even to details that were never even there. I still am like this... Quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things- I have even tried talking to a psychologist. Nothing worked. When people say good things to be- it goes in one ear, and out the other. When people say rude things, it sticks like glue. I cannot take praises seriously anymore. I cannot take advices. I do not see the worth of anything. All in all, I ***really*** wish I never existed. I have done nothing good to this world. I have been destroyed- I no longer want help. I just want it to be over. The only things that make me feel good, even just for a moment- is random things like a stranger saying something nice. Compliments from people I know, do nothing. I honestly think, the only thing that would get me out of this she will- is a semi-random situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. But we all know that is not how the world works, especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. Summary: I do not think I can be helped anymore. My mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. I was recently back at a neutral state, but then I had yet again a negative experience with another person- which brought right back down to the floor. I feel worthless- and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. This text became a complete mess, I know. There is even a ton of stories I wanted to fit in- but it will just clutter it all up at this point. The results of my depression was, a couple years back I made a deal with myself.I will give life a chance to redeem itself. I have set a date in the future- which I will not share- but it is still several years until. If I still live alone, with no friends- with no sense of purpose- with ***no light in the tunnel*** I am in... I will take my leave. It did in a way help to unload this, but not as much as I had hoped- because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life.. I do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here, but knowing myself I will probably still do it. I would also like to finally point out, that (as mentioned partially in rule 5.) most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that \"just to this and it all works out\" will not work. I am a very complicated work of machinery (not literally). For those who are just reading- thanks for your time, and if you are struggling with something I do truly hope you figure it out.. I know how it is... I just cannot figure out my issues. Not everyone can be helped", "class": "Depression"}
