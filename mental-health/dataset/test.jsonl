{"id": "8139", "text": "So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself, because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe- different dress, behaving certain ways, etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself, my personality, values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like, the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more \"pushed our\" into the world, environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am.

He was a successful realtor, breadwinner of the family, soon to be engaged and everything seemed to be going so well.It decimated our family and completely shattered any semblance of hope in the future we have. Its one of the most challenging ways to leave your family because no matter what reason you have, it will never make sense. In hindsight all of the problems he said he was having in his suicide letter were so easily correctable and fixable. I wish we had a chance. I, myself have been on the brink of suicide many times since this, but all i can think of is my mother and sister and father crying how they did when he left.Suicide takes away your pain, but it will leave your family with lifelong guilt, sorrow, and just unexplainable pain. I love you all and I hope you find peace. I am still working on mine and I will never give up because seeing my familys reaction to when I had to tell them about my bro was something that i still have nightmares about.

After a 3 year break from school, i decided i want to make a change for my life, to pursue a career as a nurse as i have always wanted to be on a medical team. I fall behind on my studies so i ought to look for tuitions. So now i have a new tuition teacher, he is efficient, had cultivated lots and lots of A score students.I am always making mistakes, its hard for me to understand what they are saying and the teacher encouraged (to me it is *preasuring*) us to interact with him otherwise we will not be allowed in class ( online classes). I do not know how to answer, my national language is not as good as the others, so i might be blurting out gibberish.He is straight foward and always say that i am wrong. It is a normal and rightful thing to say, and i do have to know if i am doing it right or wrong, it is his job, but my depresssed mind kept interpreting it as disgust because i am older than other students yet am still far behind. When he speaks, to me it is very hurtful even though it is beneficial or normal reaction or rightfully or some positive shyt. I felt that my depression, sadness and broken heart are irrational and unjustified. It is really hindering me from my studies and possibly future job, i have anxiety and just the thought of every thing concerning my studies or my teacher are making me soo sad and heart broken.What do i do? Should i go see a doctor? But my hospital is in lockdown because of the covid outbreak inside it. Should i take a break from my tuition? I do not want to be seen as a coward and run away from my problems, i also want to be one of his successful students. If i were to persue in nursing, there will be much more harder trials than my teacher correcting me. I am falling apart, me falling behind on studies is really making me depressed and despair. I think i could mention to my tuition teacher about my mental illness and take a break again from the tuition until maybe the doctor sorts me out. What do you think? Sorry for the rant. Grateful but feeling sad because of my teacher, any advice would help.", "class": "Depression"}

We did one 24 hour ride a few weeks ago, around the whole island of Taiwan. I asked if he would take me to a really tall bridge on the Southern end of the island, which would be a 12 hour drive, both ways. He thinks I want to go there to enjoy the view and take pictures. It is technically a tourist spot. I do not have my own transportation, so if he does not take me I will have to wait until later this year, when I can afford my own scooter. I fantasize about jumping: taking my helmet off, walking away from my companion, putting enough distance between us so he will not have a chance to grab me, and climbing over the guard rail in one smooth motion. I looked at the guard rail on Google maps so I could imagine how exactly I would climb over it. I do not want to stumble. I do not want to give him a chance to grab me. I feel motivated to desensitize myself to the idea jumping, so I will not hesitate once I get there. There is a small part of me that does not want to go through with it, but I have a strong desire to overcome this. I feel morally obligated to give living a chance, because I know how suicide affects the people left behind. I feel bitter and angry towards the people that love me, for making me feel guilty for wanting to end it. I cannot seem to picture a future that I can look forward to. Trying to imagine the future makes me feel agitated and makes my chest hurt. And yet, imagining my grandparents or my brothers finding out that I jumped off a bridge, makes me feel horrible as well. The tension between these two variables is driving me fucking crazy. cannot stop fantasising about suicide", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "10059", "text": "I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided \"it is time\".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son \"dad is going to work\" and he just said \"Bye\" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

Never even had friends growing up, moved around too much, just did my best to assimilate with new groups by wearing masks and leaving them behind just as quickly.Only ever had one friend in adulthood. Think she did care about me for a while, but I fell in love with her and she did not feel the same way. Between that and my constant mentally ill bullshit, guess I scared her away because she is barely spoken to me at all for almost 2 years now and I have not seen her in just as long.Never had a girlfriend either. cannot imagine it would be anything but a total fucking disaster and I do not think I can handle losing someone I actually care about because of my own bullshit again. Tried using shit like Tinder but it fucking sucks. Besides, I know I am not good enough for a relationship so what the fuck am I even trying to accomplish by asking women out? Sex is just fucking pointless to me at this point so I really do not know what the end goal is and I just stop bothering.I know people say you have got to love yourself first but I do not know what the fuck that feels like because I have nothing to go off.

Guess there is no solution.Just so fucking sick of being completely alone in the world, having to do all this shit by myself every fucking day, with nothing ever getting better or easier. And its a fucking catch 22 because the longer this shit goes on the harder it gets to be around anyone, the worse my truest issues get and the more I realise I am probably always going to be fucking unstable to some degree and Ill never be good enough to have relationships and shit because I have got nothing to offer but chaos and self-destruction.

I have noticed his overall mood, treatment towards me (not abusive just can be very short and does not really want to talk or do anything with me), and treatment of himself had been going down (not working out not showering not eating well etc) but did not think it was really bad. After a few months of me being supportive and trying to help in any way I can think of he finally said he needs to see a doctor. I was excited about that; he made no effort to make an appointment and has no general doctor. So I found him one and made him the appointment which he went to with no upset and actually for a few days he seemed happy about going and being put on some meds. Hes never been a good eater and ever since the depression hit he is been worse. I have noticed he is probably lost 20 lbs at least (he was super thin to begin with). He used to be super active as well and now he will not even go on a walk.Last night at around 3am I woke up to an incredibly large thud outside our bedroom door. (He works late or stays up late every night and I normally go to bed at a normal hour). I rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. He actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. He came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. He would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. I am not sure what caused this but I started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit (soda chips and cookies fast food etc). he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. He now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. I am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out. I just would like some help on what to do now as now I am almost worrying of I am dealing with some sort of male anorexia and not just depression. I wrote him something last night telling him that not even eating a child's portion of food everyday nor taking regular showers is unacceptable.

Like when you are watching a bad movie and it makes no sense and you want fo walk out the theatre. I say scared too because this feeling is very lonely. I am a person who is alone a lot and who is independent in a lot of ways - so when I am left alone like in my bedroom I just get such an odd feeling like this world is so unfamiliar to me. I live with my mom and even if I hear her talk downstairs I am just confused. Or if I am not with my dad I just feel confused. I know I keep saying confused because I do not know another way to explain it. I guess its just a feeling of loneliness and wanting to know too much about a concept (life and the spirit) that no one knows the answer to.

Every time I am here, it is far too brief, and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time. I was to graduate next week, and my classmates and I will likely never see each other again.

{"id": "10106", "text": "I have not made new friends in years. Even after being in summer camps for the last 4 weeks, I just end up alone and uncomfortable, left out and painfully obviously alone and out of place. Because I cannot displace my thoughts with media feeds, I am left to my stream of thoughts on how unbelievably lonely, wimpy, and drab my life is going to be, how incredibly degraded living conditions on Earth are for inconceivable volumes of people, how I am slowly and exclusively failing each of my opportunities one by one, how I enjoy practically nothing, how overwhelmingly pointless \"fighting through it\" is, and perhaps most of all, how badly i hate me for all of the aforementioned and more. I struggle to go through a full hour without concluding that I should and wholly wanting to be dead.So I figure it is probably high time to get some help before I seriously start drawing up plans, at least for my family's sake. I have done research on methods and effectiveness so I probably would not get a second chance if I really went for it. Only problem is I have no idea how to go about getting help. I am told that if I am to go to therapy, I will have to actively work towards bettering myself. that is going to be a problem, considering that at this stage I just want to die, not be convinced to complacently stick around around and pay bills and taxes for another 60 years. Do I need a will to live to benefit from therapy? Is it worth a shot to go? Is my only option to get prescribed anti depressants? Or does my stubbornness render my only choice being choosing one way or another? Simply put, how do I get help? How should I get help?", "class": "Suicidal"}

Even though I get 7.5-8.5 hours sleep a night, I come home exhausted every day, with no energy to do more than browse the internet or watch tv. When I was a student I would religiously go to gym three times a week. I have tried going three times while working, but some days I am just so tired I cannot make it. I am lucky if I go twice. I am getting fat and gross and I do not like how I look. I have no energy to do chores so my place gets messy all week and I spend a day on the weekend just cleaning and doing errands, and often all my chores still do not get done. I have no energy for socializing during the week, so my last free day is spent with my girlfriend who complains that she never sees me anymore. I do not have time for other friends or family. I miss having time to do art, truly relax, or even just walk around and observe the world. Now I feel like I am constantly rushing around with little energy to devote to life outside work. My diet is getting worse, too. On a good day I manage to make myself a tuna sandwich, but most of the time I am just eating yogurt and crackers for dinner since it basically takes no effort. I am finding I am relying more on fast food.Please do not tell me 40 hours is nothing and I am lucky I am not working 60 hour work week. The fact that I am on the lower end of what some jobs expect causes me an immense amount of dread if my job starts expecting more of me. Some of my coworkers do 10 hour days, what if my I am not as productive as them? To be honest, I rarely make 40 hours as I usually leave 15 minutes early and Fridays often an hour early.

{"id": "8815", "text": "I grew up on a farm where I saw a lot of brutal animal death at a young age and on top of all this I witnessed my parents marriage and sanity almost dissolve. Thankfully they are still together but the beginning days of the dairy farm really gave me a wakeup call that my parents did not know everything and were not the best decision-makers. I am now 25, battling intrusive thought OCD for 7 years and often extremely depressed. I try not to show it but I really want to die most days. I am kind of known as the funny guy by those around me but that is all just \"put on\" when in social settings. I feel obligated to not plan such a thing as my own suicide, because I do care about my parents and siblings, but in regards to life itself, I just wonder what is the point?I do not necessarily believe in a heaven or higher purpose, and I despair at the fact that so much unchangeable pain and death has already happened. My \"friends\" that I have always seem to surprise me with their lack of empathy about certain things and joking attitude about things as painful and saddening as suicide. They do not know that its something that is always on my mind, but their jokes about suicide still hurt because it is a serious subject. I feel so incredibly trapped by life and so in pain by intrusive thoughts. I seriously cannot tell anymore where intrusive thoughts end and where my conscious choices and ideas begin. I am a visual person that is always seeing bad imagery in my mind of things I do not want, and its so persistent that I do not always know if its me. At this point, if someone asked me if I am a good or bad person, I would say \"Yeah, I am bad\", despite the fact that I have never actually \"done\" something to anyone. I do not tell anyone this but I often wish I had never been born at all when my mind is racked with guilt and confusion. I do not think I am mentally ill, but there have been some moments in my teenage years when I did start to slip down the path of total confusion, such as a time in which I thought I may be the same person as my father. Yeah, it sounds stupid, but I thought since we did have a lot in common and he did look a lot like me at my age, maybe we were actually the same person. I often just feel that I am not in control of the types of thoughts I have and I feel at a loss for words about the kind of aimless person I am now.But honestly one of the biggest things that bursts any desire to further myself for a better life, is the hopeless of isolation. I have yet to forge an actual close friendship in the past 10 years or more. This is excluding my siblings and parents. Something where both people understand and are open with each other. Yeah, I can spout to one of my \"friends\" some philosophical commentary on life, but that is just surface level crap. I have never dated and do not know if I have it in me. So a lonely life ahead sounds miserable too tbh.The stuff where I genuinely tell someone how I REALLY feel about my life, my pain, my hopelessness and my internal rage at myself never happens. I begin to tell them personal stuff because their seemingly trustful, but then I see that they really are not engaged, and they may not even be listening.Because I keep convincing myself not to commit suicide, I often instead find myself just saying \"I wish life was already over by now.\" I mean, its going to happen one day. Why cannot it just hurry up already for me, since its always looming in the background like an inescapable punishment. I know I should not feel this way, and I am sorry for that, but as this reddit group already knows, this is one of the only places where some people can vent their frustration or share their pain in the hopes that improvement will come from fellow sufferers.

Pretty much all of my dreams are kind of staged like I am sat in front of a screen watching this TV show of the dream that switches between me watching myself on screen from a 3rd person perspective and then me in the fake show in my body like usual. Halfway through though, it basically turned into a VR first person shooter game where I was just a floating pair of gloves holding guns and I had to choose whether to spare this random guy or kill him in order to finish the game. Then I suddenly realised I was dreaming, and of course, I am just like everybody here and I think about suicide all the time, have not been happy with life since I was 11 or 12 and am in a nearly constant state of misery. So I took that chance to try and kill myself, started with shooting in the side of the head but it did not work. I just \"took damage\" because of the stupid I am in a video game thing going in the dream. So I took out a shotgun, held it under my chin, shot myself and I died.There was this brief moment that lasted no more than a second where I had zero thought going on in my head, it was all black and I has absolutely no clue what was happening. Maybe I felt what it was like for a bit but I doubt it. I woke up, but it was not one of those things where you jolt awake just before hitting the ground, I woke up like normal as if this dream was not extremely fucked up.Killing myself, did not feel like a relief like I thought it would. It just felt wrong, in some sick way, it felt too easy. I have known for a while now that I will probably never kill myself, purely because its too much work and I cannot even leave the house or brush my teeth let alone find some method of suicide. Now I know for sure that I will not kill myself. From that moment forward, I will just sit in hole suffering with no escape, and just let the world pass me by. I have no easy exit anymore, so I will have to just deal my shit some other way. Not exactly a better option, but I prefer it I think.If you are reading this and you still want to kill yourself, suicide is not all you imagine it to be.

My mum is a psychiatrist but I just do not want to vent to her at all, it is a bit weird for me.I am a 20 year old male who like the majority have had ups and downs in life, some last a few hours and some last a day or two but this one has been ongoing for about 5 months now. In February I decided to go to Holland to work there for 3 months with my best mate and his family to earn and save money. The idea was great and the outcome money wise was also great. Although the outcome was good the whole experience was on of the most depressing and stressful experiences ever, going from job to job, north, east, south and west and even living in a motor home for a week when there was 6 of us. I decided to bring my girlfriend with me 3 weeks into the trip to help her look for some work also but that was the worst thing I have ever done. She never found work as there was nothing about for a 19 year old female which caused her to get depressed and down staying in the house hold for the remaining months with nothing to do due to lockdown being so strict in Holland. It caused us to clash, I was working 54 hours a week 6 days a week so I was not the happiest which caused me to also be in moods.After coming back to the UK with a nice bit of money saved I decided to invest it into driving and a security course for a new job. Driving did not go as planned and took me only until last week to pass the theory even though I arrived back in the UK in end of May. I done a 6 day security course and passed the exams first time, only then to find out I have to get a Overseas Criminal Record check because I use to live in Spain which I am still waiting for. So for the past months I have been jobless, sitting in my room watching the days go by. I then fell in love with the sport of boxing, it got me motivated to go out and workout so I am not stuck in doors all the time, I still love the sport now and I was going to classes without fail for 3 months straight. All of a sudden my motivation has just slumped. I was suppose to go to Spain to see my parents who I have not seen for about a year now but due to consistent overpriced covid tests to and from we could not go which broke not only me but my parents. All these aspirations are falling apart. I want to be a boxing world champion and I know hard work will take me there but at the moment I am not wanting to do anything. I have ate takeaway for about 2 months straight now and letting the food I bought at the shop go out of date because I cannot be bothered to cook. I have become that slumped and lazy that I have turnt down working a few days with my uncle which would do me some good and help with money. Me and my girlfriend have had a rough few weeks of arguments which almost broke us up a few times but thankfully we spoke about it and seem to be getting better. I have made some progress with a few things and I have not drunk any alcohol for nearly 2 months now.But I am just lost, I am skipping boxing today because I just do not want to move, I cannot even be bothered to shower which is unheard of because I am such a hygienic person.I do not know what I want out of this but maybe just some advice or words of courage and tell me to stop being a bitch and man up Lost and need advice", "class": "Depression"}

There were periods in my time I had hope or I tried, but it always failed. I am a human like everyone else, with similar desires, but not everyone gets what they want or even need. Not everyone gets help, not everyone gets cured, not everyone gets saved. it is called life, it sucks, I hate it, but I have come to a place of acceptance. I will be alone, I will be isolated, I will have to rely on distraction from getting through this miserable life. Thankfully, I have a vast imagination and since I was a kid I have lived in my head. In my imagined world I can be who I want, look how I want, have what I want, achieve what I would like, be with who I want...But occasionally I have moments where depression really fucks with me. Voices in my head reminds me how fucked up my life is, how alone I really am, how I will never have what I see and hear what others get and so easily because their life turned out better and they had a better chance at gaining a life. The world in my head is so much better then reality and I wish it was real, for my sake and the sake of so many others who can relate somewhat.

I am not going to pretend like I do not have any friends or something; the truth is I have more than I can count.

In addition to this, I have a girlfriend of 3 and a half years who I have been feeling distant with recently. She is always upset with me and has become less understanding of me and the things I try to tell her. I think the reason for this is that were both growing but unfortunately were growing in different directions. It just pains me to know that despite all these people in my life, they all see me as a crutch. I am someone to talk to when THEY have an issue. Once their issues are resolved they only keep me close enough so I can help when they need it again. I just really wish I had somebody in my life who could match who I am that I did not have to be a therapist for. A person who could level with me instead of trying to be under my wing.

{"id": "13020", "text": "Honestly, this is my first reddit post. I have never felt this way before. The story starts way back about a year ago. I have felt some sorts of depression throughout my early teens and have experimented with extremely high (retarded in fact) doses of OTC medication to see the effects and what would happen with the goal of not waking up over some stupid shit I honestly should not have been stressed about. Some dumb ass shit like getting yelled at or getting in trouble. I have been diagnosed with ADHD since elementary school and have been pumped up with adderall and melatonin everyday in order to just act remotely normal and behave. Around the beginning of high school I stopped everything completely and did act out a bit in school and with my parents, but nothing severe. I then started smoking weed, and a lot of it. I was high for probably 3 years of my life straight. Every morning, and every night I would get absolutely blasted in order to just keep to myself and not because any trouble (and a good nights rest). I vividly recall in grade 10 trying to stop smoking and I did not touch anything for a full week and I felt out of it and fried for the whole week so I just kept it going. I started to sell to keep up with my habits, and that is when my parents caught on. I would lash out and just be a brat towards my whole family. In grade 12 I failed my first 2 classes of the year and was not on track to graduate. My parents kicked me out, and I left the country to stay with close family. I was doing all my classes online and had great success. I decided to go towards the route of Engineering (specifically software) and got straight A's in all of the prerequisites needed for university. I took a full year (8 classes) of online high school and finished them all in a semester. I enrolled in university conditionally for the program and am just finishing up my last finals in order to upgrade my university classes (I also graduated high school early and got my transcript). The problem is when I came my family would just shit on me and say it was all my fault I got in this position, and that if I did not change I would kill my parents. I would finish my work and in turn I would get liquor on the weekends to celebrate a job well done. At this point I was studying 14+ hours a day, 7 days a week with no days off. At this point for a long time I was drinking on my own to cope with myself and help me sleep (keep in mind I have been out of the country away from my families house since the beginning of the school year). My family I am staying with took my phone and went through my group chats and found old snaps of me smoking with my friends and what not, and took my phone away. I have not talked to my parents, or my friends in around 8 or 9 months, with the exception of my parents calling my family and in those situations they would mute the phone and force me to smile, say everything was alright, and give the phone back to them so my parents would not suspect anything. Around 2 months ago when I graduated I started hanging out with my cousins and partying, and that is when my family found out I did cocaine, smoked lots with them, and drank regularly. Currently I am not addicted or dependent on anything, but I am at the lowest point of my life. I life my whole life wrapped around the finger of my family. I can not watch tv, listen to music, work out, hang out with my family, or even take elongated breaks to eat or take a shower. My family is planning to have a road trip back to my home country to drop me off to my parents, but I truly do not see myself seeing my parents, friends, or family ever again. I genuinely do not see myself going to university, or even going home. Currently I just wake up at 4:30, and study until 8:30 with 15 minute breaks to eat and take a shower before I sleep. I used to love talking to people and eating and hanging out, now I only feel remotely content by myself. I feel no urge to eat, I feel no contentness with my life, and I am overwhelmed with guilt for all the pain and suffering I have caused my family back home. I have zero appetite and like fucking clock work I puke my guts out every morning at 7:30. My family forces me to eat and I can not hold anything down. I am rapidly losing weight, and am losing the urge to live. I know I am for sure missing a lot out and it may be mixed up, this last year has been the craziest year of my life, but I think I got all the main bits in. I was just wondering if anyone felt this way, and if anybody thinks I am crazy, or being driven to that point. My family assures me its all my fault, and my lack of appetite is me screaming for attention and I am a attention seeking bitch, but I truly feel no urge to eat, and every day they just yell at me worse and worse and it pushes me closer and closer to the edge of killing myself. I truly am at rock bottom, and ready to end it all. I live my life in darkness, with nothing to look forward to, and no light in sight. Please let me know what I should do.

Back in April, one of my close friends was even diagnosed with depression. In February and March, my teachers were punishing us for our bad behavior even though I was not part of the group of people who caused them. In May, one of my teachers called me a politician who lies because I was running for Student Council President in my school. How come I respect others yet I do not get the respect back? I have felt depressed and lonely since the beginning of this year and I am losing hope in the future. Making new friends is impossible since my parents get mad when I make online friends because apparently all of them are pedos and that they will kidnap me or something. Covid has not helped either. My friends are like Things will get better but after hearing that many times, things 100% have not gotten any better. Why do I deserve this? What have I done to deserve being depressed? If I died, everyone would care for like a week, then everyone will have forgotten my existence. do not have an easy way to kill myself either. Maybe drowning or no water could work. Honestly, if I could choose the option of killing myself without any pain, then I would choose that. Why continue suffering through this pain any longer?

{"id": "11200", "text": "[Trigger warning] This is mostly based on the fact that my mom always wanted me and my siblings to go to the curch but I was the most sensitive one.I do not have any friends so I did not talk about it with anybody but my mom but I cannot do that anymore.Three years ago I confessed for the first time that I tought God was evil and they told me to pray for things to change.Three years later I have always been praying with the same feelings and now I cannot even think about God without feeling hatred and despair.When I was a kid my mom always tried to get me to go to the Orthodox curch and fast. Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping ,I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say \"forgive me God\",I was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h ,to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50/100 prostrations and reading everyday ,fasted for half a year every year, I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick, and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday, not to make a single sin and do everything right.Now cannot go to curch anymore and I want God to dessapear and to live a paceful life but I fear I cannot.I want this to end, be it depression or anything else.I am hurting myself and cry every single day for the same reason for a year and my mom does not really want me going to a therapist nor to get medicine.Sometimes my family makes fun of me and over all does not care.I do not have any friends and I do not know what I will do with my life.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool back then but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and thinks suffering it is my fault for having a bad temper.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father told me (my father was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one; when I was arownd 13 he told me I may become a slut because I was having impure toughts and that gave me so much suffering for all these years,now he died and my mom still thinks he was a saint but thinking about him is like thinking about hell)All these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I do not really want to make up with God.I tried but things only got worse every timeI cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.Even now it is the same.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it gave me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like \"it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed\" and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven ,I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head :how if you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair, and crows eating the belly and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?I do not know if my family is bad, my dad is disinterested but my mom never let me believe that God can be interpreted in any other way,and I am scared to do it.She also thinks that God is all loving but the fear of God is the first love.she will make fun of other people who do not have the same beliefs as her and I hate that.She also thinks that I am genuinely a bad person and that I have to change.I do not think she is ok with me not being perfect, she tells me \"if you behave like that you will end up in a hell hole in life, nobody is going to be good with you\".She wants me to always forgive ,she always tells me a story with a woman who confessed she was getting bitten by her husband and the father told her to keep water in her mouth all day(so she would shut up).She wants me to accept life is trash and be humble and kind no mather what, sometimes she just tells me I do not understand and that is why I feel like this is bad...

I became popular, had a wide network of friends, lots of parties, lots of sex, I experienced so much in my early to mid 20s. But I got older and got more responsible. I made a lot of money and I became independent. But now I sit here pretty much alone. I thought I had a close knit group of friends but I do not hear from them anymore. I am lonely. Have been for several years now. I want to meet a woman, but none will give me the time of day. I want to make new friends but I have pretty bad social anxiety around new people. Idk what to do.

A lot of changes happened during that time frame, and I did not cope well nor did I receive any help. I threatened to end my life on multiple occasions while on school campus to school personnel. Anyway, now I am in my 30s and still struggle with SI and OCD. I am constantly fearing abandonment, I am incredibly insecure, and I always think that I am messing up. I get incredibly anxious in social situations too. I have had many mean things said to me, and I just always have my guard up now. I am in a good place now. Job is good, Florida is nice. But I still cannot escape this wanting to jump out of my skin feeling. I feel so uncomfortable. I cannot look in the mirror for too long. I feel like I am going to ruin everything. I isolate myself typically, but I am married and I do not want to do that to him. I constantly feel guilty. I am trying to practice positive self talk. I tried contacting a few crisis lines today, but either I no longer qualify for the service or there is just a long wait time. I have never had any luck with those anyway. And I do not contact the 1-800 suicide prevention hotline because the last time I called the guy was rude, would not listen to my issue, and threatened to have the cops sent to me. Also, I do not want to end my life, I just want for this to stop. But the constant feelings mentioned earlier just make me want to end it. But I have so much to live for. I want to travel and I do not want to hurt my loved ones. I am hoping that these feelings will eventually go away. So, I am going to keep trying the positive self talk. I will be contacting my therapist later. I may need something more intense. Just talking about my problems does not help me at all. Trying to think positive. I am rambling, just sharing.", "class": "Suicidal"}

This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

I have wanted to do this every day for months but every time i think about it its as if my head becomes so heavy i cannot physically bring myself to move. I have tried doing it in smaller chunks or even just taking the stuff out of the boxes but i always end up losing motivation halfway through. i have one summer class left that i need to take in order to graduate college. i have not kept up with the content. i have not been doing my 1 weekly homework assignment for the last two weeks because it seems pointless although i know, logically, its not. i was able to do my midterm essay for the class a few hours before it was due but that is only because its worth 40% of my grade and the time crunch finally pushed me to do it. i used to care so much about my grades but now that i only have one class left i cannot even get over this enough to do what i need to do to pass it. my therapist does not understand these issues when i explain them to her because instead of asking for help most of the time i act happy and like I am getting better during our sessions. every time i do try to let her know what is happening she unintentionally downplays it because she does not understand what i mean. I have told her that i have issues with motivation and i know she is trying to help but she just sent me links to videos with motivational speeches and it does nothing. i do not know what i need, but i do know its not that. if eating, being happy with my own space at home, and possibly not graduating college is not enough motivation for me to do my stuff, then some random words of encouragement will not do anything for me. despite wanting to do all these things and make these changes i KNOW will make me happier and feel a little better, nothing so far has motivated me to do so. i feel trapped with my thoughts, moving a thousand miles a minute while my body keeps me laying down. my head stays glued to the pillow. i cannot keep existing like this but i do not know where else to find motivation from when i want to do things for my own sake. i can only do things if people are counting on me to do them.", "class": "Depression"}

I have been depressed most of my life, so waiting for it to get better before starting a relationship is not really a smart idea :/-(we both currently see professionals for our mental health)-**TL;DR: Can i/should i start a relationship while dealing with long-standing mental health issues (mainly depression and anxiety)?

I am newly diagnosed with ADHD(yes I am on medication and starting therapy, but therapy has never helped me before) which answers so much but leaves me with even more questions about my self worth. sure it explains why I have never been able to focus or do things I need to, it answers why I have always felt so wrong and why I have always had issues with my emotions and co trolling myself, but it also makes me feel like I am just even more likely to fail at life. my boyfriend does not even want a mentally ill me. my mother never did. I feel unmotivated and unhappy every day, I feel like I can never properly sort things out no matter how hard I try. And it feels like I try so hard everyday I wish I could explain to everyone how hard I am trying and I know I need to sort thins out (Today I contacted all my debtors but that is not good enough apparently even though it was so fucking hard) and get nowhere and I am so fucking tired, I am so tired of trying and trying and being told its not good enough. I am not confident enough, I am not smart enough, I am too distracted and too emotional. my boyfriend (ex??) was right tonight. I am going nowhere. it does not matter how hard I try. started smoking weed a few years ago at uni and its one of fhe few things that makes me feel normal, happy and less anxious bit it also makes me a bigger waste of space.mental health does not excuse me not being confident enough to speak to people or the fact I forget things maybe this is just my personality and I am just a pathetic person who is not capable of living. I am always just going to be a pathetic little girl who does not do enough. my head hurts from waking up and trying and I just want to stop. please, I just want to not have to try anymore and be what everyone wants but I never will be and I just want to stopeveryone leaves me because I am such a waste of space.

{"id": "16831", "text": "Sup guys so I have had a funky time with mental health. After having a very fun depressive few months.. years on and off I really and I mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.I have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. And you know I am really fucking happy to admit that I think I am almost there. But its like I am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when I look down I can see the type of person I want to be but becoming that person feels like I am going to have to jump off and here is why. I want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. I want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. I want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. Start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. I want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the Opera house at sunset, meeting new people, having lots of plants, doing things that make me feel at peace. man, I just really want to start enjoying life.But every time I do things that I have always wanted to do I remember why I did not do it before and what stopped me. Every time I wear clothes I am excited to wear I keep thinking how bad they look on me. I remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits I might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down I did not like how my body looked on all of them. I have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat I look. I am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say I am fat yeah know? however to my mum, it is beyond every time I come to have a conversation with her, she comments on my weight, my hair, my looks. I remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after I got A's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things, the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if I get better grades my mum will get off my back. But its as if the more I try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. But she is my mum, she is toxic sometimes but I know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. There so.... strict and hard to talk to. So judgemental. So overdramatic. Whenever I talk to them I get reminded why I did not. My mum always says I am just avoiding my family I say that I am busy but the truth is I just want to have a nice time with them but I am scared. I am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain, peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. Whenever I do art, write poems do things that I like I regret doing it because I simply do not have time. I barely have time. School takes up most of my time, it is like I have no free time. Every time I do have free time I study. Study, study, study. Even though I am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. I cannot stop thinking about school. I go tutoring in the city, so aesthetic train rides to the city? Yeah reminds me of all the hours I spend on Saturday doing math. it is just that. When I start getting better, all I can see are my flaws. I am emotional, a workaholic, stressed all the damn time, insecure. I get so disappointed, Soon enough before I know it. All the motivation I have to get better disappears. And I am back to square one. I think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding I am very flawed but what after? And how do i get past this? I want to get better for myself, for my mum to stop worrying about me, so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother, being a bother to my friends. I really want to stop hating life because to be honest I have got so many good things i want to look forward too, so many good people i love. Yet deep down i *always* get worse, *i always get dissapointed, i always get fucking tired of life all over again* I want this time to last. How do i look at my flaws and not hate myself and get depressed all over again? How can I look at my flaws and still be... ok?", "class": "Depression"}

I was never in love and kissed only one girl who was a really great friend of mine and we decided we want to be each others first. For a few months we were like a couple but we definitely were not in love. Fast forward to university. I decided to become more socialized and played less video games, went to uni parties, etc. I have kissed quite a few girls and had some makeouts (sex) with some of them. I even had two girlfriends but both were casual and I was not really in love. My last relationship ended a few months ago. And now uni over, started working, having a good job but lack of friends because I moved to a new town and only know a few people here.It started hitting me in the past weeks that I never had a true first love in high school or uni. I never had a successfull date where I kissed a girl. I honestly never experienced TRUE love. I met ALL the girls in my past years at parties or pubs and had something between us because either we were drunk or the girl was into me.And it makes sad that I am almost 24 years old and my youth is kind of over.

I started going to therapy last month or so and I was progressing well. I was diagnosed with dysthymia and I was going into a more stable and functional state. I started to do my schoolwork again and I was managing my stress and intrusive thoughts better. I was proud that I was recovering and I was so excited to getting my life back together. But I guess I spoke too soon and I ended up relapsing this week. I do not know what triggered it, but I feel like it happened because I had a lot of slip ups this week (like messing up while doing chores, upsetting a friend, etc.) I ended up planning out three suicide plans and writing a tear and snot soaked suicide note (pretty gross I know). I am pretty angry at myself right now, because I feel like I wasted the efforts of my therapist, my friends (who helped me a lot with dealing with my bad stuff) and I feel like I wasted my own effort. what is worse is that being angry at myself just fuels my desire to kill myself even more. I do not have the guts to tell my friends about what I am feeling or thinking cos they are going through their own problems right now and I feel ashamed to even tell them because I am an awful friend cos I suck at being there for them emotionally (I am still learning how to be empathetic and how to comfort others, nobody really taught me as a kid so I am still developing on that aspect). My family does not acknowledge I exist anymore, and I am falling behind my school work. I just want to end things, because I just do not have a desire to live anymore. I feel like I am a burden to others, I have been pretty much abandoned by my family, I just do not see the point of living anymore. If you have reached this far, thanks for reading my rant.

{"id": "14484", "text": "Title pretty much says it all. I have been attempting to get long overdue issues resolved, and on track to better life, and a happier life. I have been unable to continue to support myself off savings, and I have been waiting since December for unemployment payments, so I got a decent job and now I regret accepting the job, because having any pay over 15 hours @ minimum wage (12.50) is considered too much for healthcare assistance.Yet when I do my budget with my newfound income, the best insurance they offer, and expect to max out my out of pocket yearly, I still come up with over 4 grand out of pocket. that is 2 entire months of income, with rent already being 40% of my income, that is just not possible to do.So either I give up on the job, lose any continuing unemployment, and go homeless, in order to get the care I have waited my entire life for, or stay with the job and be stuck in the same misery I have been in for 15 years.I have been trying to get caught up on care for 3 years consecutively, 10 years total, but not the only time I have attempted to see doctors. Each time either my insurance chances (New insurance company at a job) and I lose my doctors, or I change jobs, and lose my doctors before any meaningful work is done, or the one time I did get an answer to a good chunk of my pain (Non-diabetic Neuropathy) and got care, I lost it a little over a year later simply because the office closed in my state and went out of business. No alternatives, and no follow up care since primary cannot take over a specialists prescriptions. I no longer needed answers, it is lifelong, so why is my quality of life to suffer? Why do I have to live in misery yet hold the answers to my biggest issues?Did I mention Primary Care doctors are useless? Not entirely their fault I assume, as they cannot or will not assist, I have to see a specialist for every little thing by law (or policy? everywhere). Lifelong foot issue? Need to see a new Podiatrist again, for the 6th time, painful neurological test? Must repeat it because you could not have medical records, that is impossible! Gastrointestinal? Nope. Missing Organs, need extra vaccinations such as COVID. Big fat NOPE, even though the scar is larger than my dick. Psychiatry? Nope.Oh Got injured and need physical therapy 2-3x per week for 7 weeks? Good luck! None are open after business hours, so they expect you to feed yourself off physical therapy? you are supposed to feel better when you cannot afford a bed to sleep in?I am fed up with this world, if we want to have private healthcare ACT LIKE IT. I should not have to PAY for services where nothing happened! I should be able to shop around, meaning transparent pricing! Insurance should be dirt cheap, and only there for major emergency visits.Otherwise, do what is right. Healthcare for all!I could rant for days, but I am just so tired of it.

{"id": "10051", "text": "I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time \"it will be fine, you can talk to me!\". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ \"friends\" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself.

{"id": "15281", "text": "I will be talking this over with my therapist as well but more to the point, I \\*think\\* I may have finally found my... button? Fire? Motivation? I do not know what to call it really.&amp;#x200B;Perhaps I am getting too far ahead of myself here. Allow me to give you some information. &amp;#x200B;So essentially, depression is a static state of mind. It rarely changes. it is a very set in stone style of thinking. Of all the things I know, one major aspect I learned was that depression, or rather sinking into the thoughts and feelings of depression is very much like meditating. You sit there and focus on the pain, the regrets, the turmoil, those feelings of worthlessness, suicidality, hopelessness and on and on it goes and it is so hard to challenge those thoughts because they get SO loud.&amp;#x200B;So I have been studying, researching everything and if you look through some of my posts on this sub, you will come across some of my own theories and perspectives that deal with depression and functionality. &amp;#x200B;Ok, so niceties out of the way, let us talk about the plan.&amp;#x200B;First of all is the center piece, the schedule. I know I am low enough to need to schedule EVERYTHING. Bathing, brushing my teeth, sleep time and so forth.&amp;#x200B;However, I am also taking this up a notch. The way I figure it, I am either going to burn myself out and rupture or I will succeed. Either way, I will be out of this mindset, away from these feelings. &amp;#x200B;So in terms of what else is going to be added.&amp;#x200B;Tuesdays/Wednesdays are usually my therapy appointments. &amp;#x200B;Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are my gratefulness journal &amp;#x200B;I will be doing my own therapy session using CBT and I am thinking that will be once a week on Saturday to spread out between my therapy sessions and CBT sessions. &amp;#x200B;I am also going to force myself back into my old morning ritual. Pretty basic stuff; starting at 5:30am, get up, brush my teeth, morning meditation for 20 minutes, cup of coffee and breakfast, 30 minute walk, shower and shave, daily objectives journal.&amp;#x200B;I am also planning to add a self acceptance meditation into this perhaps twice a week, which will be a 20 minute meditation geared towards embracing my neuroses. Re-intigrating the fragmented parts of myself. &amp;#x200B;The basic plan right now is to hold this schedule for 4 weeks to build that habit and then I am looking to quit smoking. I have been smoking for 14 years now and it is about time I quit.&amp;#x200B;Along side all of this, I also want to add on one last aspect. I want to volunteer down at my local homeless shelter. This will give me an outlet for my energy so it is not so geared towards being used as fuel for depression and at the same time gives me positive feedback in seeing how my actions can make a difference. Plus any kinds of friends I happen to find as well as looking for references so I have something to show when I attempt to get employment. &amp;#x200B;I have been working on this plan for literal months, finding tid bits and pieces that I found crucial in forcing myself out of this. we are going nuclear. My mind does not have a problem sending nukes to destroy me, so it is time to return the favor.&amp;#x200B;I have got several tools for practical use against daily depressive episodes, such as the realization that I am literally meditating on that depression when I allow myself to sink into it. As well as a few other techniques such as bridging my thoughts, this means subtly changing them bit by bit. So \"this is useless\" becomes \"maybe it is not as useless\" or \"I will never be able to do this\" becomes \"maybe if I give myself a chance, I can do this\" things of that nature.&amp;#x200B;I have already beaten and almost entirely silenced the parts of me that were suicidal. So I know some of this stuff works. But that was target practice, it is time for live fire. The real deal.&amp;#x200B;Considering the tools I have got, the information I have and everything else, I believe it is time to make that change. I know I do not want to die like this. I want something more. But above all, I know the most important detail. This, all of this, it is just practice. that is all. It does not need to be threatening, it does not need to be scary. it is just practice. &amp;#x200B;But what do you think? Feedback, please? With a cherry on top?", "class": "Depression"}

My girlfriend is out of town for the moment and I have been avoiding telling her how I am feeling because I do not want to take away from the fun she is having with her friend in Maine. there is so much I want to tell her, so much I need to tell her. I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is, and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context, me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another, but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat (that I have been gone from since that day) It was her birthday, and she asked if I could go along with said friend, who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday, of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before, and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable, and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable, the whole day I was falling apart, and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day, I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend, I could not do it, and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel, that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself, I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it.

He thinks the dark part of him is not lovable. so now he cannot commit to me in the future because he hurt me he says. A big reason of why hes afraid is he cannot commit is because his depressive behavior has pushed everyone he loves away eventually. His love language is acts of service. But my love language is words of affirmation because I have horrible self esteem issues (which I did not know I had until he pushed me away).this unlocked me pushing him more to reassure me, and let me to have massive anxiety and being extremely emotional around him. I was super clingy and begged him not to go but he forced the breakup because, life has proven that he has hurt someone by not being enough and not loving them right and that his demons are too much. I have started therapy and realize that maybe its possible to heal my emotional trauma and not require the words of reassurance once I have higher self esteem. But he does not believe me and wants to let me go so he does not hurt me more down the road. But a stupid part of me still wants to fight for him. Now I have been 2 weeks no contact. he reached out a week ago and said he missed me terribly and he keeps checking on me. but he does not sound like he wants to date me again because he wants to set me free. he sounds guilty now. asking me if I am ok, telling me to enjoy life and go out there and be happy. hes being selfless.I love him and he says he loves me. we both need space to heal rn. should I still stay there are a friend.. or something like that? after a little time of space?

I was maybe around 14 when I first started sneaking alcohol and weed I found in my parents room and god it fucked me up so badly.my body could not take any of it, especially the alcohol but I kept coming back to it because I found it to be a temporary escape.soon after, I dropped out due to failing grades and behavioral issues which lead to my worsening downwards spiral.now it is been a couple years and my father died due to heart failure and other complications but I never felt any kind of sadness twords his death, I did not go to his funeral either because I could not bear to look at him. however, all of those feelings I should have felt are now coming back and I feel like absolute shit because I feel like even though he want abusive, I should have built a relationship with him.I spent my whole like being jealous of everyone who has a happy relationship with their fathers and it really fucking pains me to know I never had one with mine. my heart is racing because I am not use to opening up to people but, it is the internet so why not?

Ill speed this up though because I do not want to take up too much of your time. In like 6th or 7th grade I made friends online playing overwatch with a dude, like really good friends. I never had a buddy I could talk to casually and safely about literally anything from after school until 4am. We used to have a joke where wed just tell each other do not be a bitch for advice. It was laughable, really it was, because we both knew each other would give real advice anyway. Those would end up being my most hated words ever.Back in April of this year, I had a decently healthy relationship with a gf I had for about 6 months, and got accepted into college and was graduating High School. My friend and I started FaceTiming and he started to drive. He told me he should stop and I told him to not be a bitch. We told each other jokes and laughed really hard. He turned to look at me for a brief moment, looked back at the road, and got in an accident. His head went through the windshield and he died instantly. I panicked, and I do not usually do that. I felt enormous guilt, I still do. What had happened I felt was my fault entirely. So much so that I promised that it would never happen again. I left my gf and all of my closest friends for their safety. That was the hardest decision of my life. They all tried to get me to stop but i did not listen. I played Minecraft with my now dead friends little brother, he must have been 7-8 years old. I have never heard a kid cry like that. I did not even have the balls to tell him what happened or that I was sorry for it. Flash forward to about a few weeks ago, I tried overdosing on pills. Obviously that did not work, I guess I am inept? But I visited my grandparents house, started going through some old stuff. I found my grandpas old pistol and held it up. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I could not do that either. I wussed out. I have tried drinking to forget or maybe honor my lost friend(s) but nothing works. I cannot sleep. I guess I am asking for help but honestly maybe I do not deserve it. I am sorry for writing so much, maybe I just needed to get this off my chest.

Things are going to a lot different, and I do not think I am ready for it honestly, since all my daily routine has become completely pandemic-oriented.

I met a bunch of friends, had tons of ambitious goals which I found genuinely excited about, met my ex-girlfriend who kept me company through the first half of the pandemic. However, everything's different now, 9 out of 10 of my friends transferred to other universities, those goals I had were abandoned because of again the darn pandemic, and finally my ex.

Throughout all of this I am trying to combat PTSD and doing everything in my power to not self harm or jump straight to suicide. I kill the thoughts immediately.ButI'm slipping. I have to give a little bit in some areas to compensate for others. And I keep having to do it, so now the thoughts become longer and more enticing and grip me.I am so fucked right now, I cannot even self mock and laugh about it.

{"id": "17681", "text": "Recently, I realized my depression stems from life being a never-ending cycle of having to... always do things. The laundry is never permanently done. Every time I wash my hair and get it nicely styled I will have to wash it and try to get it looking nice again. And again. And again. Every time I finish a project for work there will be another one. I always have to eat (would not it be great if I did not need to? Either I forget to eat, do not have the energy to eat, or I eat too much). Every time I lose weight I gain it again and I will have to work super hard to lose it again. Every time my face clears up my period comes around and I get another breakout again (and then spend too much money on makeup to cover it up, which also does not help my skin). I excelled in school, but I was always in this mindset of \"I just need to get through this \\_\\_\\_ and everything will be great.\" Fill the blank in with whatever you would like--semester, project, shift, day, hour, diet. I was only ever powering through things then, and slowly, I got worse and worse at doing that and started missing deadlines and not taking care of myself (going to bed without brushing my teeth, skipping showering because I was running late and feeling gross all day, etc.) I chalked it up to Senioritis. \"Oh, I am just a bit burnt out, I will gain my productivity back after I have a bit of a break.\" However, that Senioritis has NOT gone away, and now I am out of school constantly sending \"So sorry I am behind on this...\" emails because I cannot keep up with work at all. I self-impose deadlines only to miss them. I have others put deadlines on me only to not hit them. And it is not because I am busy. I am not. I graduated with my MA in December and I cannot seem to land a full time gig with it or even get a chance to interview anywhere. I am not qualified enough for a lot of jobs (I am, like, half qualified) and that makes me terrified to apply for fear of looking stupid or--what if I get the job and then I do a bad job and destroy future career prospects? Currently, I am freelancing and doing part time work but I am not making enough to move out of my parents house and that only makes doing the work I am doing now feel all the more useless and makes me procrastinate even more. I am letting people down. That used to be the worst case scenario for me, but now I seem to have moved past that into full apathy. I am just letting my professional self that I worked so hard to build in school fall apart entirely because I cannot find the will to do more than drag myself out of bed at like noon (I work remotely) and force myself to eat something. Just responding to a simple email is the biggest win I have had in months and whenever I do manage to force myself to finish something I feel like death after--sucked of all energy and life with a raging headache. God, life is just so exhausting and there is no excuse for it other than I do not want to go on and do not have the energy to do so. \"I think I may be a bit suicidal\" is the scariest thing I have said aloud to my mom, and I think I freaked her out. I am only 24 and I wish my life was over despite everything being amazing on paper up until this point. What has happened to me? It used to feel like there was a light at the end of the tunnel but now I think it is just a never ending tunnel. There is no end. Just death. But at the same time I have so much I want to achieve and see and do. My creativity is actually something I think I have managed to gain back after years of school punching that out of me, but you do not get paid for being able to doodle or write the occasional story. I do think that my small personal projects with no deadlines and no eyes on them but mine are the only thing keeping me going right now, but even THAT feels like work half the time. I say I love writing, but that is not true. I love having written. I do not like the doing, just the \"have done\" feeling where I get the satisfaction of completing the thing and it being good. But is it even worth the work for that rush? I do not even know what to think anymore. I am just done. 2021 is half way over and I have done nothing with it. I started the year off in a bad place and it has gotten only worse, not better. No progress whatsoever. Life is just doing things", "class": "Depression"}
{"id": "12601", "text": "I (17NB) have been dealing with depression and anxiety for the past 5 years. At the end of this school year, I thought I was finally cured; I thought I found my purpose, rediscovered hope, and made really good friends. That all came crashing down when a relative passed away due to the current worldwide issue. For the past two weeks I have been feeling the worst I have felt in a long time. The relative who had passed away was not very close to me herself, but her passing changed my parents and turned them verbally abusive and now I hide in my room all day to avoid talking to them so I do not get screamed at for the most mundane reasons. Along with night terrors which I have been dealing with for months, I have been crying daily, and have been not letting myself sleep and isolating myself from many of my friends as a form of sh since my mother checks my skin daily. Moreover, I did not even notice at first but I started restricting and then binging and this style of eating mixed with my lack of sleep and anxiety about my home life landed me in the hospital for newly developed health issue.Anyways, I have started trying to manage my issues. I set controls on all my devices so that they do not let me use any apps from 11 pm to 7 am, and I have also been making myself eat 5 really small meals per day so I can keep everything down while eating enough. The only issue I have been having is reaching out to my friends again. I am in the Bay Area, and restrictions are easing despite the increasing cases and new strain concerns. I managed to open myself and my issues to a really understanding friend of mine, and he invited me to go to SFO with this group of friends, and while I am glad to have been invited, this trip is causing me so much anxiety and I really need an outsider's opinion.On one hand, I really want to go. I have not been around people in so long and I feel like if I do not talk to someone who is not in my family I might explode. On the other hand, while this friend group has been nothing but nice to me, they make me nervous. Like, I am not a very popular person at school; I have been kind of bullied up until like last year. This changed when I made friends with this group, who is very well-known and quite popular, and people started treating me better. While they are all very nice, I feel insecure when hanging out with them because they have always been more popular, more attractive, and they are super close with each other so they make inside jokes and reference past trips they have made while I feel left out. Once they even forget that I am with them and did not include me in a conversation for almost 3 hours. I feel like if I do not go, I am going to feel depressed and horrible that I did not go on a fun trip as teen that I can talk about once school starts and I am going to feel jealous they got to bond without me. But if I do go, and they all have a lot of fun while I am trying to keep up with the convo, I think I might burst into tears on the spot.Then there is also the fact that my parents will not let me go at all, first of all because of increasing cases in the area and the new strain, but also because of my health issues mentioned above. I know this seems like a super first-world and stupid problem but all these issues colliding into this one weekend trip is causing me severe anxiety and I feel unable to think. What should I do?tldr: dealing with probably my lowest point, trying to get better, invited on a trip with sort-of friends, idk whether I should go or not due to mental and physical health issues as well as worldwide issues. (tw grief,slight sh, ED) It keeps coming back and never ends-- advice would be appreciated", "class": "Depression"}

While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature.

To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey.

{"id": "7681", "text": "(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. \"Work on your self esteem\" or \"You sound insecure\". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities", "class": "Depression"}

I have family I have my parents, I even have friends but do I really have them. I am sorry if any of you feel hurt /robbed by what I say but I just wanted to be honest. I have family, who does not hate me, or rejected me because of anything, I am lucky I have a roof over my head. I do not have to live paycheque to paycheque, and I am immensely grateful for that. But I am tired of feeling this way, I do not understand why it is so hard, every single person in my entourage has a great life in a way or another besides me. And I start feeling so inadequate when I have to \"compare\" myself, to homeless people, sex slave, child soldier, I know I am just seeing life through a grey lense, but why are those the only things making me understand that my life is not so bad? Trust me I do not want any of their conditions, but why am I not satisfied? Why is it so much easier for others? I am not rich but I am not poor, I am below average. I am not smart but I am not dumb (at least I wish I am not.) The only things that makes me believe I am not dumb is how I overanalyze everything, and you cannot be \"that dumb\" and not be happy at least I wish, because otherwise I would not have anything going for myself. Everyday I wake up, my body hurts, I feel nauseous, my back hurts, I get migraines, or my eyes are crying(because they are dry), I loose my balance, my vision gets dark, I wake up tired, whether I sleep 20 hours, 14 hours, 8 hours, 5 hours or 3 hours, I am still as tired the only difference is if I wake up with a headache, or I get it along the day. I had to move out 6 times in 5 years(maybe to all of you it sounds like nothing), but I was not able to form any meaningful friendships/relationship in 1 year. Even if I give it my best shot, if I try to act like somebody else, or like myself, if I copy' s someone behaviour, I pretend I am someone I am not or if I pour my heart's out, I tried it. The only thing I cannot be is mean. I am not pretty enough, rich enough, smart enough, or white enough to be any of that. I do not have any talent, sometimes I like writing, sometimes I like watching tv, sometimes/before I used to swim, I am not good at anything, but I am not able to feel satisfied with anything that I do. I really tried to work on my body, but it made me so tired, I started puking, and more than once I started feeling suicidal, ready to jump in front of a train's track, or a subway, or even from a building but at the same time I will not. it is true that I am scared of it failing, of me being paralyzed, but I am even more scared of missing out on life. I want something great, amazing, to happen to me. I think hope keeps me going. And if I am being honest is my life that bad? My family is lucky, some are \"rich\", or at least got much more money than me, some are pretty, talented, athletic, popular, good with words, they got cool friends, and I seriously talk to them, and I tell them how I feel, I told them everything and I also told them stuff I did not want to share,and now I am frustrated because I told stuff I would rather have kept hidden and it is not mine anymore, it is theirs, and they have yet to show me they care. I realize that even if I died, and told them exactly what to do, for me not to die, they still would not do anything about it. And that is not their fault and that is the worst thing about it. I and they cannot do anything about it, and I just have to accept it, and they should not have to do anything. But really I just want a friend who will bring me to their house, and who will come to mine, well watch movies, laugh about dumb things, well go to the mall, or maybe thrift stores, well try food, laugh about dumb passerby, or talk to random stranger and then run away. I am not asking for much and yet I cannot find it. I do not want anyone to date, I do not want sex, I just want something simple. I want to be happy, I do not need a Prince, or a dream anymore, I do not need to be the richest anymore, I do not need people to remember me or my work, I just want to be the most to somebody who will be my most important person. If that is too much to ask I know why I am Sad, I know what does not work with me, I know what I am missing but I will not get it, and that is enough to make me believe that life is not worth living, but I am still here, because I know how easy it would be to find, and I am still waiting for it, I am still waiting for them.

I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my \"explosions\", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends.

{"id": "9298", "text": "this is my first reddit post ever. I am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one I have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds I have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. I am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. I am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my \"natural healing\" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "15406", "text": "TL;DR - Chronically bored, if that is a thing. I am doing perfectly alright. If I look at my life from the outside, I would say I am kind of an easy-going overachiever. Somehow I have cracked the formula to breeze through my academic and professional life with the least effort. This effort I am talking about itself is not out of laziness or arrogance (not completely at least), but out of sheer boredom. I guess I am making this post because frankly I have got nothing better to do. Somehow my uninterested ass always seems to get decent friends who look out for me and call me to fun events. I do not blame them a bit for it because they know I would do the same for them. But I do not fucking enjoy anything beyond a point. it is always been like this and always will be. For a long time, I, like an idiot, thought that I must be super smart. Maybe that is the reason I do not relate to anything. This juvenile line of thought, thankfully, ended when I came across smarter, more hard working peers in college and the workplace, who put me right in my place. I am digressing a bit. So soon I figured out that I am just an average, arrogant dumbass whose arrogance got cured a little bit in a healthy manner. But that led to the next question. Then why am I still so bored? I have tried various things to help with this. Forced myself to work on projects, forced myself to go out, forced myself to do relatively well and heck, I have even forced myself to a healthy lifestyle of vegetarian diet, daily exercise and meditation. do not get me wrong here, I did see some proper benefits out of all of them, but soon my old curse of sensing routine got into me and I eventually stopped. That is still fine. I know I will get back to doing good things again soon when my brain gets it shit right (its cyclical), but again, as you may have already noticed, I know I will get bored. So what do I do? I have changed academic tracks out of boredom, changed routines out of boredom, heck, I even changed my professional track out of boredom. I have done open mics out of boredom, unashamedly hit on girls at the bar out of boredom, came up with a serious start up plan too, thanks to boredom, lol. Right now, I think I might just take up exercise again so that one day I can go rock-climbing. But that engagement will also be momentary, sadly. I will probably do one easy rock and then come back to my routine bored self. Perhaps, I will take up photography when I am 45. Get a fucking Harley to get away from my wife and kids (not there yet, but probably will be owing to normal human routine), but soon get bored of the Harley and dump that poor shit. So ending this shitfest of a post, let me say, I am probably not depressed. I am definitely not lonely and I am definitely not a very good writer either lol. Just was in a bad headspace right now so made this post. Thanks to any kind soul who read this whole thing. I am doing alright.", "class": "Depression"}

I have had to be my own caretaker for a long time, she is never really been there for me emotionally and sometimes even physically.I have wanted to off myself for awhile, actually. I guess I am just worried about the after part. And it is not like I *want* to feel pain on my way out.Maybe I just do not want a surefire way of ending it because I wanted someone close to me to just.. realize how miserable I am. I kind of want to do it just as a jab at my mother. \"This is your fault.\" that is what she would think. Or rather, it is what I would want her to think.It baffles me that I have been able to fly under the radar so long. it is probably selfish to think this way, but I have been living like this for so long and if things do not change I will have to take initiative.Only one person actually cares, and he is someone I know that is online. he is kept me clinging on but I feel bad relying on him all the time. My mother has done nothing to help. I have seen three therapists and she just uses that as ammo against me.

I was so afraid to see a new one because if I did and it went badly, it felt like there would be no hope left. But the day I decided to see her was the day after the closest I would ever come to suicide. It was after some emotional experiences that left me feeling like I could not go on anymore. I did not want to hurt my mom so I reached out for help. I saw this woman for nearly a year but recently her response to my suicidal thoughts was downright unprofessional and hurtful. She reprimanded me and told me to think about what my suicide would do to her. And she set up these ridiculous rules that any time I mentioned even a thought of suicide or self harm the first thing she would do is call my dad. Mind you I am in my 20s. She had no right to break my patient confidentiality like that. When I told her that if she set that rule, I just would not talk to her about such feelings which would make it much harder to reach out for help. She basically did not care. She was the first psychologist who did not dismiss my feelings. When I told her I felt so bad that I needed to be hospitalized, she sent me to a psychiatrist who was incredibly dismissive of my feelings and then made a change to my meds that included quitting the meds I would been on for 2 years in three days. I felt awful. And I felt like I lost all trust for that psychiatrist. This is not my first experience with mental health professionals and they have basically all been bad. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like I am at my rope's end. All I think about is death to the point where I feel unable to hold a normal conversation. It consumes me.

I will keep putting myself in more trouble, mania issue. damage all of my friendships, destroying my relationship, pushing everyone away, racked up 15k of online gambling debt in the past 2 weeks, etc.a few days ago i wrote a suicide note, and then an apology/goodbye to the only loved ones i give a tenth of a fuck about (5 people)at work i wrote up a list of all the shit i do and how to do it, since my location is a very very small group of people.anyways, I am out, my dudes.just wanted to let that out. thanks for reading I am out", "class": "Suicidal"}

For a few years now my depression and anger have taken a bad fucking turn. it is gotten so bad that I have been pounding brick walls and getting into fights as a form of self harm/punishment (stupid I know but it also keeps the anger in check).About four months ago I stopped taking my meds, I mean they barely helped me anyway. No one really knows what is been going on with me and I think that is for the best. I am about to start college in about a month and I am extremely tempted to kill myself before then.Days just blure together and the faces of friends start to lose their meaning. I honestly feel like I am out of options at this point and I do not know what to do. I wish the best for everyone that reads this but I do not believe that anything good is in the cards for me.

I am on a break before uni now and every day i am basically free. I should be so happy that i have a few months of completely no responsibility or so it seems. However i feel so utterly horrible sometimes and today is one of those times. I am crying as I am typing this and i just feel so bad about myself. I have not even picked a course for uni and I just have no idea what to pick, I cannot pinpoint my interests and I have no true passion and at this point I am just such a hassle and an annoyance to my family because I cannot get myself together. Maybe I should just pick a course and go with it regardless of my interests? At least that way I make a choice. I hate myself too and ever so often I get reminded about it when I look in the mirror closely. I feel useless and I have no talents and I am not good at anything and I feel like nobody really truly needs me here. I sound like I want to be the centre of the universe but no I just cannot help feeling this way, like nobody wants me. I wrote down in a book a list of things to do but i can barely get myself to cross one thing off that list. Its just so hard to do anything other than binge watch shows and play games. I know many are not coping well in the pandemic but I do not think my friends have gotten to a point as low as I have. In the day when my familys awake I look fine and dandy but when the clock strikes midnight and everyone goes to bed I am alone with my feelings and thoughts and that is when the demons come out.

{"id": "17791", "text": "For the last year and a half Id say I was self medicating with opiates. (Lots if not so much fun) every day I would wake up and need them. By 48 hours I was puking my guts out. I was not doing your regular boy or H as they say, I was addicted to them round little blue M 30 fentanyl filled disastroids. And I also experimented with some of that G too. (never was really a fan) but eventually I said man I am going to lose everything I spent less time worrying about my loved ones and more time trying to find money for drugs and let us not forget the times the dealer was out and did not have any. I woke up one day and said fuck it. I am not doing this anymore spent 12 days hurling and had explosive diarrhea. It was hell. But something was missing. I got a sponsor and finally found out why the fuck I was self medicating for so long. Turns out I needed to see a psychiatrist. Long story short I got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. Many of my peers and even some family do not believe in my hardships. But I struggle every day just to smile. Even when my child is around. I just wonder when Ill feel better completely. If that will ever happen. Sorry for the bitching guys. But I just wanted to share this. Btw I am 3 months clean. Thanks for listening to my rant if you did. Please someone tell me it will get better.

{"id": "15622", "text": "Everytime I complain to my boyfriend I am depressed he tells me that I should not be - that I am beautiful, smart, have a good job, have a boyfriend who likes me and lots of friends who like me. But the day to day weight of being unable to change my situation gets to me. I feel like if I spend money on my favorite food, its pointless. If I walk 10 minutes somewhere, its a drop in the bucket. Buying cute clothes or makeup, or driving around to go browsing items would only be a temporary dopamine satisfier, but Id feel empty inside ultimately with too many things in my already filled closet. Going to a music festival would he fun, but it would just cost a lot of money, Id be tired from the travelling, Id be frustrated with my friend pushing me to do things I would not like. I find negotiating all the relationships in my life exhausting, disappointing and full of tradeoffs, but I do not know where else to invest my time instead. A career that I am in to ascend the ladder just seems designed to make me overwork my underlings in a corporation that destroys the environment, while surrounded by coworkers who are obssessed with their job title and work. The sex with my boyfriend is great, he is caring enough, but I am just full of doubts in my life. I feel that I am not doing well at all and that I am always going to be miserable. I feel like I have to keep busy, wear myself out until I sleep, to numb my feelings and get by. And I constantly feel like jumping job after job, and escaping, but I do not know where to escape too.

{"id": "16061", "text": "Bear with me please, this may be extremely lengthy but I will encourage you to at least read, some of the information in this may be helpful to you.&amp;#x200B; Also as a note, there is going to be a lot of technical talk here. Please do not be dismayed by this, it is an info Dump just fair warning.&amp;#x200B;First of all, welcome and thank you for taking the time to read this. Given the subreddit I am posting this on, chances are that this information may be of some benefit to you.&amp;#x200B;I am an observer, not in a solely perceptual context but I see, for lack of a better term, everything. I am kind of monster in that sense. I am not like other human beings and to address that statement, I give you my own personal theory on the 4 main aspects that you humans associate with being human or at least how almost every society would like to be seen. I give you, The 4 Core Personality.&amp;#x200B;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_&amp;#x200B;let us start with the basics. What are these 4 cores and how do they pertain to personality?&amp;#x200B;The 4 cores are; differentiation, extravertedness, conscientiousness, and an overall positive disposition. &amp;#x200B;How are these 4 aspects incorporated into our understanding of personality?&amp;#x200B;These 4 aspects give people a general overview of who you are and how you react in a given context. Say you are a natural introvert, that plays into how you are perceived by others. Some may see you as distant, closed off or uninterested. This feeds into how they interact with you, just as an example. There are countless ways this construct comes into play on a daily basis, in every interaction you have with someone else and in some cases even within yourself. &amp;#x200B;By creating this construct, there is a natural field of exclusion. Granted, societies generally try to keep this umbrella as open as possible, within a given measure. Which leads to outliers, people who are naturally not built within that frame or for those of us who have had that aspect stolen away via actions of others, trauma.&amp;#x200B;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_&amp;#x200B;let us dive a bit deeper into these 4 cores and what they actually mean, what branches they build and how psychology aims to utilize these things to help the outliers who seek assistance. &amp;#x200B;Starting with differentiation, this measures our ability to regulate our emotions, particularly in events of high stress. In short, it is your ability to keep undesirable emotions from being expressed and working those issues out within yourself. &amp;#x200B;To give you an example, you might think of a person going through the cash register line at your local supermarket. At the finalization of the transaction, the person offers several coupons but those coupons are mostly expired. &amp;#x200B;Are you the kind of person to:&amp;#x200B;A: chalk it up as a loss and just pay&amp;#x200B;B: require a manager come for the purposes of clarification &amp;#x200B;C: completely lose your mind, throwing the items off the belt and at the cashier as well as other customers &amp;#x200B;If you picked C, CONGRATULATIONS!! You just won the grand prize, take it away Johnny!&amp;#x200B;you will be enjoying your stay at a luxurious jail cell, a room with a view! And if that is not enough, you get an all paid trip to your destination!&amp;#x200B;Thanks Johnny. &amp;#x200B;Although, emotional interaction is a bit more complex than that. Sometimes it is more about your ability to control undesirable emotions in certain situations. A couple examples I can give you would include; laughing at a funeral, falling in love at first sight, getting frustrated when the waiter forgets your water. Things of this nature.&amp;#x200B;Society does not ask that you NOT feel these things. It asks, quite simply, that you do not act on those emotions. How you work out those emotions is of no regard to society, it does not care how you deal, so long that you DO deal.&amp;#x200B;Next up, we have extravertedness which is your ability to maintain several connections with others, your ability to enjoy the company of several others (being in a large group or \"herd\"), your ability to rely upon others as well as your ability to allow others to rely upon you.&amp;#x200B;For this example, we will turn to Susan. Susan is a bit of a homebody and prefers to be at home reading books. However, her new friend is more extraverted and wants to invite Susan to her cousin's wedding this next Thursday. What should Susan do?&amp;#x200B;A: begrudgingly go to the wedding and hold the action over her friend's head in the future&amp;#x200B;B: Suck it up and go attend the wedding and try to have fun&amp;#x200B;C: Say she will have a migraine that day and cannot go&amp;#x200B;If you picked B, congratulations!! you have made the right call. This demonstration of willingness to interact just made a wonderful impression on your new friend and now you have got a trauma bond to boot because her sister got too plastered and was puking her guts out and you were there, helping your friend to help her sister into the bathroom stall. You now have a friend for life so long as nothing catastrophic occurs between the two of you. &amp;#x200B;Next on the chopping block is conscientiousness. This is the measure of your ability to provide kindness, compassion, sympathy and empathy. Your ability to foster a connection with someone and help that connection grow, helping those around you to grow as well as continuing to grow yourself. &amp;#x200B;For this example we turn to our announcer, Johhny who is one of the most conscientious people I have known in my life (Legal disclaimer: Johnny is not a real person, this is a fictional character. Any resemblance to any person living or dead is not intended).&amp;#x200B;Johnny is at home, working on the truck when a buddy calls him. His buddy is an alcoholic and is calling because he just slipped and got drunk. What should Johnny do?&amp;#x200B;A: \\*hangs up phone\\* not my damn problem &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;B: oh man, what happened? Where are you so we can get a cab for you&amp;#x200B;C: I am sorry man, where are you at? I will come pick you up.&amp;#x200B;If you picked A, CONGRATULATIONS!! Your friend was just pronounced dead after stumbling into oncoming traffic because he thought he saw a silver dollar in the middle of the street.&amp;#x200B;And now we come to the final round of our show, this is it. Winner takes all. The ability to believe in the overall good.&amp;#x200B;This is a measure of how you see others. Are you able to trust others to be as considerate, conscientious and reliable as yourself? &amp;#x200B;For this example, we will turn to Betty. Betty has always struggled with believing other people are genuinely good due to several traumatic experiences through her life. Though she is trying to get better through therapy. One day, her therapist says something that does not quite sit right with Betty's morals, what should Betty do?&amp;#x200B;A: discuss this discomfort in more detail and clarify how it effects her view of her therapist &amp;#x200B;B: immediately and abruptly get out of her chair and exit the room screaming \"you are the f###ing DEVIL!!\"&amp;#x200B;C: keep her feelings to herself and hold onto that resentment &amp;#x200B;If you chose A, congratulations! you have made the right call. Sometimes it is hard to believe other people are genuinely good but the true societal test is in being able to establish reason and context as to why you do not trust people but still have the desire to in order to improve your life and the connections you establish. &amp;#x200B;Well thank you for tuning in today, I am your host, the abyss, saying have a wonderful day out there and you are beautiful!&amp;#x200B;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_&amp;#x200B;Now that you have an understanding of what I am talking about, here is my dilemma. I see you, I know what is expected of me. But people keep insisting that I be authentic. Be true to myself. &amp;#x200B;What if I cannot do both of these things simultaneously? What if I have to choose one way or another? would not it just be more beneficial to just obey the rules and hope that one day I will believe it through social reinforcement? Or do I keep being who I actually am? This observer, forsaken from society. All alone and cold, only able to see the wonders and treasures of humanity. Never to actually take part in those things.&amp;#x200B;This creates a major dilemma inside me. it is not bad enough that I am severely depressed, that I feel utterly worthless, that I have only a few strands of hope left to hold onto. It was not bad enough, I had to know in great detail the reasons why I am not like the rest of you. Why I am a monster. &amp;#x200B;But in that knowledge, i also know exactly how to be one of you. But i have to sacrifice my own comfort in this eternal cell to do so. I have to sacrifice myself to become one of you. I cannot keep being pinocchio, nobody wants a hollowed out puppet. I have to be a real boy if I want for real people to accept me.&amp;#x200B;That is my dilemma and I know I am the only one who can make that decision. But what would you do? I have a Dilemma (4 core personality)", "class": "Depression"}

I had a new job that fit well with my college schedule, grades were great everything seemed to be going on track. Once quarantine began I lost my job due to COVID and I fell behind on grades. At first I just felt like shit, kind of numb. Then halfway through I turned things around worked on myself a lot. But the biggest thing getting through depression was thinking about life after quarantine I told myself I would make it out a winner. The first couple of months were great. One of my goals was to start Brazilian jiu jitsu which I love because it pushed me to new heights mentally. Another goal I had was to be more social and go out more. A lot of my goals are in the process or are already done. But Deep down I am still numb. I am not sure why? I know happiness is not a linear path but when I know I am supposed to feel something I my emotions are not there.. a part of me feels like a narcissist that expects things so I cannot enjoy things? Should I seek therapy? Extra: One of the parties I went to had this really attractive girl a majority of the guys there were trying to get at her, the typical talking extra loud or sprinkling a little lie to make them seem more interesting. Me being the typical cool guy I just introduced myself and that was it. Guess it worked because her sister said she was interested in me and gave me her number. I kind of just shrugged it off l. Now I am not trying to boast on the internet that I got this girls number. All my friends hyped up the situation but they do not understand that even after that I still do not feel anything no sense of accomplishment not even a confidence boost. Still emotionless.

{"id": "17563", "text": "I am in about 2 years worth of average wage in debt, and actively having suicidal thoughts.I have been addicted to drugs, alcohol, food, nicotine, you name it. All of which I have been able to overcome.Up until recently my daily suicidal thoughts were not like \"I am actually going to kill myself\", it is more of a \"I do not see any other option\" and \"what if\", basically thinking OF suicide but not actually doing it, if that makes any sense.I am not sure why I was leaving this part out like I do with everyone in real life, it is anonymous after all.Basically my debt is caused due to a crippling gambling addiction. Been addicted since 15 years old, I am 20 now. I just got a tattoo, which I can not pay for now, which is the main catalyst to the real suicidal thoughts. There is no way I can get the money right now, and I am dreading the moment he calls me.Every time i think of suicide I am thinking of my family and friends, I can not imagine the impact it would have on my parents, always makes me end up crying. At times I think so what, I will be dead so I cannot be sad about other people being sad right? But my whole life I have lived under the simple principle of others above myself. I will always put the happiness of others ahead of my own. So in the end I do not see myself being able to pull through.Not even sure why I am typing this here, I am not expecting any sympathy or help (since we have all heard that life is worth it, do not stress over money, think of your close ones etc), I guess I just needed a place to vent.I do not think I am doing as bad as some people on this sub. I do think of suicide but my life is not all that bad in the grand scheme of things, i just do not have anything that makes me happy, but i do not have anything that makes me mad, feel unfair, or even sad (except when thinking of my family), which is a positive I suppose.Weird thing is, whenever i think of suicide, I am thinking of clever ways to make it not look like suicide. Like natural occurance, freak accident, etc.P.S.My heart is quite fragile, so the method i thought of was simply putting a bit more pressure on it with simple stimulants. But again, its just a thought I am not planning on it. Suicidal due to debt among other reasons", "class": "Suicidal"}

No indication one way or the other, just that we will revisit once this separation period is done.I am resolved to end things if she decides to leave me, but what can I do in the meantime. Living on the edge like this is pure agony, and every day I feel closer to some final decision. I do not want to reach out to her about it because I do not want it to influence her process.

I work 2 part times jobs, one at whole foods, and the other at a physical therapy office. Tbh my main reasons for working are not even the money it is to do something. I also train baseball players 3 times a week for 1.5 hours. I also workout 5-6 days a week, and go on walks when I can. I also study Japanese, and study different scientific topics in my free time, and I occasionally make youtube videos. I do a lot, but I still feel incomplete. I still feel like I have no direction in life because I do not know what I truly want to do. I am afraid to commit to anything. Also, I have trouble talking to people especially women. I am so incredibly shy and sick of not being be able to talk to girls. I also do not really care for hanging out with friends. I occasionally go out, but really only so my parents will not say anything to me about not being social. I started a YouTube channel tbh in the hopes of making a career off of it. But within weeks I lost the desire and care for making videos. I still make videos, but do not really care. I think I was driven to make videos in the hopes of fame, because I frequently compare myself to YouTube stars who are the same age as me and already have their life seemingly figured out. I work out, and struggle with body dysmorphia. I constantly think of myself as fat or small, and am never satisfied with myself. I compare my strength to people on the internet and end up feeling insecure af. Even those motivational videos where a guy with a missing leg is doing squats or something makes me feel bad. I think to myself he has 1 leg and I can barly do that.I work to fill time. I work at physical therapy office to get experience because I have thought of becoming one, but tbh I am not that interested. I just cannot think of anything else to do with my life. I want to be able to work for myself, but I cannot think of any ideas that would allow that. In short I am extremely lost.

{"id": "17463", "text": "At first i did not know what it was, i just felt empty, sad, lost interest in all of my hobbies, nothing was fun to do anymore. I did not take it seriously, \"probably just your teenager hormones messing around\" i told myself.I began searching on the internet for weeks and i eventually understood what it was, fucking depression that is. Probably caused from many years of extreme shyness, social anxiety and self isolation, i was scared of people and i had no personality.I failed highschool 3 times, it took me 6 years to finish highschool. In my 5th year of highschool (19-20) years old) i only had 4 subject to finish, so i had pretty much 80% of free time the whole year. I promised myself i would get a job and actually be someone, do something with my life. I failed, got called for 6 interviews and i did not even attend 4 of them (huge panic attacks), last 2 were on a more discrete place with less people around so i eventually had the guts to go inside, first one i had a panic attack right at the beginning, interviewer seemed cool about it at let me take some deep breaths, i went through the interview but he said at the end \"I am sorry, but you should really consider seeking a therapist\". Last interview, i did sweat a lot, i had a very shaky voice, i was extremely anxious and could barely look at her in the eyes, 5 minutes into the interview she says \"you are not really qualified for this job, I am sorry\" and i left.After that day i hit the rock bottom, a few months later i rested my forehead on a loaded shotgun for more than an hour, trying to get the courage to pull the trigger but the only thing that came to my mind was my mom's reaction seeing me dead with my head blown out. I could not do it.Last year of highschool, only 1 subject left and again, could not even apply for a job, my anxiety was getting worse and so was my depression. One day at 5 in the morning i decided, this is it, I am going to end it right now. I got into my car and drove to the nearest cliff by the sea (huge 100m drop), i just sat there on the edge for about 20 minutes trying to find a reason not to do it, once again the only thing that i could think of was my mom's reaction. Eventually an old fisherman saw me and called the police, i kind of got away saying i enjoyed sitting while looking at the sea and i do it nearly every morning.Got into university at 21 years old, 2 years went by and just being occupied with something eventually kept my mind busy and suicide thoughts went away for once. Nowadays, 23 years old, 2 years of university went by, still never had a GF (or even a female friend), i made 0 friends, i still have 0 experience talking with women (i have not had a female classmate since i was 16). I promised myself that university would change my life just like it does to many people, once again, i failed myself (my social interactions got a lot better and people do not notice that much that I am weird, but I am still shy as fuck).Summer holidays just began, depression is growing again at a fast rate, no one to go out with, i have 3 friends from highschool but we go out like once a month at best, my closest friend just got a GF so he only talks to me like once a week just for regular stuff. 2 weeks ago i spent most of the time searching for ways to peacefully kill myself without making too much of a mess, i planned to jump of a 75m bridge into the water or maybe try again the 100m cliff, and also thought about taking a bunch of sleeping pills, go into my car and and let a butane gas cylinder open inside... I do not know how to help myselfSorry for long post, i have too much shit going on in my mind, and who knows if i end up doing it in the near future, i will send my reddit account to my closest friends so at least they know what i had going on in my mind. 4 and a half years of depression and suicide thoughts, is there any hope?

Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore. Everything is a chore and requires a tremendous amount of effort to do.I just want to feel productive again, but I am not sure what to do.

I have completely lost entire conversations, and looking back on those conversations (the ones I can actually read because they happened over text) it seems like someone else wrote them. They include details I do not know literally until I read them, and leave out things that I now do.I can never remember my best friend's major. it is engineering, I think, but which sort? I have no idea. I have asked him about it dozens of times, I know that much.Friends are always introducing me to music. A few months later, I will invariably try to introduce them to the same music as if the first conversation never happened.I recently broke up with my partner. Part of why I did was because I felt he was an awful communicator. Then it came to my attention, through both him and other people who were close to the situation, that I actually just *straight-up forgot* a great deal of our communication on a few key issues. I remember it now, but I do not know if it will stay that way.I am an active member on a worldbuilding forum elsewhere on the internet, or at least I used to be. Looking back at what I wrote there, it feels so... foreign, again, like someone else wrote it.I can never remember my childhood as clearly as my sibling. They can recite to me all kinds of things about family gatherings, semi-distant relatives, and various other memories that I have absolutely no connection to.I am horrible with names. I used to think that it was normal, but now I am questioning that assumption in light of everything else.I am currently visiting with a friend. Planning logistics for this trip has been an incredible hassle, because I have thought that we discussed things that we never had a conversation about, and entirely forgotten conversations that *did* happen.I can never remember the tasks I need to complete. I always thought that it was laziness, or my capacity for straight-up denial, but I am not so sure at this point.Everyone--*everyone*--that knows me, apparently knows me to be very repetitive in conversation, far more so over the course of a day. I had no idea. I always think it is my first time saying something until someone tells me otherwise. I always thought nothing of it, but...This is an awful revelation. I feel like I am going crazy, like I do not know what is actually real in my life or what *looks* real just because I am missing some key detail. I am afraid that I have forgotten so much about things between my ex-partner and I that the breakup made no sense and was actually caused by mental illness instead of a genuine understanding of our situation. I am just really, really afraid. I do not know what to do.Is this explicable with depression alone? Do I probably have something else? Are there SSRIs that improve memory, or some other effective treatment? Please, any answers would be of help. I am really frightened. I am depressed. I have really, really bad memory loss.

Where I live, it turns out they are allowed to hold you involuntarily until they do not think you are a risk to yourself anymore.Before I knew it, they took me to the unit that is completely locked up. This place was the absolute worst. Its so confined, people are screaming (some screaming about how they want to leave), the food was garbage, there were no group activities to learn how to cope and get better. It felt like I just checked into a prison. The outside area is all locked up and super small. It felt absolutely suffocating. I am pissed because I thought I would be helped on how I can cope with these thoughts, what to do, etc. Instead, the nurses just medicate the hell of you when you tell them you are anxious (because you are locked up and all you can do to pass the time is wander the halls). And you see the psychiatrist maybe once a day, sometimes every other day for literally under 15 minutes. What a goddamn joke. I will never, ever check myself into a hospital ever again. Granted it made me grateful as hell to leave and actually enjoy the outside, but I really thought I was going to lose my sanity in there. Mental health seems like such a fucking joke.

I honestly realise that it is better for her that she does not have to burden herself with someone like my current state (I know fully that it is a burden). I just hope that, maybe someday, she can see the \"real\" me again and we can go back to how things were at the beginning. How things were for me in the months before. I guess I am still upset that things had to end this way. it is my fault and I have to live with that.

{"id": "10078", "text": "So I am moving to a different apartment next week, and to be honest, even though moving is a serious pain, it has been one of the best things to happen to me.I have made a decision to get rid of most of the stuff I have, I have basically thrown away 80-90% of the stuff in my current apartment and kept only the basic 10% of stuff that I need. Over the last two weeks, I have spent a lot of time just cleaning up my current apartment and throwing out stuff that I do not need or donating it if it is in good condition. The decluttering has lightened my mind so much. it is like someone has just lifted a huge weight off my head.I have lived here for the last 6 years, 4 of which I have spent in depression and honestly, I cannot wait to get out of this apartment in a couple of days (I move on Wednesday). I am feeling proud of myself for taking and executing this decision to move out (even though I did not need to, as everything was just fine with this apartment otherwise). It really is a much needed change that I am looking forward to. I hope the new apartment brings better luck and better mental health in my life. If you are depressed and feel stuck in a particular place, just try and move if you can. It really helps you to assess what is important to you and what is not, sets you in motion and brings about a much needed change of scenery. it is really good for your brain.

{"id": "17598", "text": "Idk who goes through what in their lives but just tell me if you have ever felt this, the way i did cuzz i just want to know people are facing the same shit as me or am i really the 1 in a million as my doctor said once to me. I had the worst night in my life and what happened today it happen before too but it was like rarely so for me this was not a big of a deal. I always keep my phone far away from me when i sleep like above me and when i need something in the night usually i do not but in case i do then sometimes my hand would reach out to the phone and sometimes it will not reach, or sometimes i would just yell and someone would come. Last night i got in a very uncomfortable position while sleeping and normally i would come back to my sleeping position but idk why i could not move myself forward it is not just my legs it is my whole body that does not work and I have been in this place before, i remember when i could raise my hand and one day i could not, there was a time when i used to walk and then i could not even stand, or when my internal organs started failing. Okay so what is next now? My voice i guess cuzz in the end vocal cords are also muscles and I have this disease Muscular Dystrophy so my every muscle in my body is going to die so i will not be able to speak in some years well that is too bad cuzz everybody says I am very talkative. Sometimes I have the strength and sometimes I am a person who cannot even move a little by herself. So I am like yah whatever let us just call someone to help me out so i tried to get my phone but i guess it was my lucky day my hand could not reach to the phone then i tried shouting no one could hear me they were all in their room sleeping. I was not able to sleep leave that part what is the worst was, cuzz of the uncomfortable position in which I was my leg started to pain so badly and all i wanted was to get out of this pain i shouted for like 2 hours straight still no one could hear me that moment i cannot even explain how i felt... how weak, how hopeless these words are not even enough for me honestly it straight up felt like a cruel torture like i was in a hell and i kept wondering why is this happening to me? What did i do? WHY ? why someone would put me in this miserable life, in this almost dead body who does not have any strength to even move a little, is this you call living? No i think for me the living is dead.After 2 hours my mom woke up and she said from now on keep your phone close to you while sleeping. In my head i was like yah i will keep my phone close to me from now on but what about the fact that I am dead? Or maybe i died again in those 2 hours and maybe I will die like this someday again!. Whoever sees me may call this life of mine living but if you are not sitting in my wheelchair then i do not think you know how i feel. I will try to explain you how it feels like to sit in my wheelchair... I was very little when me and my family got to know that I have this disease called muscular dystrophy and there is no cure for it in the whole world even Stefan Hawkins had this disease not the exact one as mine cuzz this disease I have, it has many types but they are all quite similar. I was born with this disease but it can come to its real form in any age of your life in your 20s or in your childhood nobody knows so you see I was a normal kid back then I used to go to school I had this many friends and I was also the prettiest among everywhere I go and now it is all gone my beauty, my friends, my normal life idk what is left in me now. It has been 9 years since I have been bedridden. My brain, heart, lungs, my facial features and my senses, back bone, fingers, voice, and a little bit of hand movements these all things which I have mentioned only these things work for now other than anything in my body which I did not mention is dead, like for example my legs and my digestive system. I am very thin, the kind of thin that I bet you have never seen before cuzz of loss of muscle in my body, my coller bones are unusually deep, it is like my bones are super visible and when I say I look like an alien I mean it. You know I can keep on writing about my problems cuzz there are so many and believe me these are all the minor ones i have not even started talking about the bigger ones I just do not know what to do with this life it is like there is no control no certainty about my life or neither of my death I am just stuck in a middle of nowhere where I just wake up everyday to have 10 kinds of different pain in my body and despite having them I have to live as a happy person cuzz nobody likes a person who is depress all the time.

{"id": "14674", "text": "Something told me to make this post. I do not want sympathy, or I am sorry, or any of that. I am past that. I have made lots of posts in the past to get that kind of response. That kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. This post is not about that, it may seem like it is, I suppose, but it is not. I guess, I just want to tell the story of why I have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, I do not expect many people to read it.I have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. By contemplate, I mean I held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. I have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. It has put me in a state where I am both godless and god-fearing. The best place to start, I think, is the first trauma I remember and go from there. When I was about 5-6 I had a crush on a boy in my class. If it matters, I am a bisexual male, more on that later. Well, I was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so I told my mom about the crush. Her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. I still have the scars to this day. Four scars on the left side of my face. I made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, I do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.That is the tip of the iceberg. When my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. Hot summer days in the Ohio River valley. We would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. And really I guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. So we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. Anyways, I really looked forward to school days. This went on for a few years, I was between the ages of 5 and 10.School itself was not so bad. I did not learn to read until I was in the 3rd grade, and I was always taken out of class because I had special classes I had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, I could not say my Rs, the speech impediment went on till I was almost in High School.Well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, I say fun because I try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. I remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. We lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. Entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. Directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. The third door was my father's apartment, to the left. A white door, it led into the living room. There was a fireplace, a smallish TV, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. In fact, I am going to stop here and suffice to say that I could describe to you every detail of that apartment. All except my room. I can not tell you anything about my room. I do not know what color the door was, I do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, I know nothing about that room. What I do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that I was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. Aforementioned memory lapse aside, I am told by my brother that I say \"No, do not do it, stop\" in my sleep quite often. My sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. And thirdly, NSFW warning, my anus has a tear in it. I was about 12-14, as memory serves that I lived in that apartment on the weekends. A mighty bold claim, I do not remember the actual events, but I believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. I want to think that I am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.There are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but I think they really do pale compared to what I have already said. To this day, my family is, well, unloving. They will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. In fact, the only time they really listen, or half-listen, is when I threaten suicide. This could be why I contemplate it so much, just to be heard. Neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions I have, what love I feel. Two examples, I wanted to be a paleontologist until I was 16, loved dinosaurs, I kept this, like many other things, to myself., until one day I told my dad. He said I would never be a paleontologist, I should give up on that idea, and that I should instead be an engineer like he was. The second example, I love playing the piano, I know virtually nothing about it, I am self-taught, and frankly, I feel I can play a pretty damn good improv. My mother, frequently, tells me I am terrible at it and that I need lessons. Which may very well be true, I may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, I do certainly need lessons because I cannot read music, although I do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and I like it that way, so I am stubborn.Perhaps some of this post is just whining, I need to grow up, I need to move on. I should not be defined by my past or what others say. And most of the time I try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but (I was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, I feel it is needed here) the past can still hurt. And perhaps that is why I am making this post, not on a throwaway account, I thought about that. But like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. I have come to the end of this post and I still don' know the purpose. It does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly I am not even depressed about it right now. I was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because I have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. Maybe, and I think this is true, maybe I just need someone to know these things. Not because it has any real impact on their life, I certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, MY GOD, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. No, I think I just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. I suppose I am sorry you read that. Me", "class": "Depression"}

I will not be the one to make sure it happens but I am going to pray for it, preferably in my sleep. Some may think its for the dumbest reason ever but that just makes me feel even more alone. Yesterday, after having a really fun night, my fucking brainless dad decided *that* would be the best time to tell me I got a standby summons for jury duty next month. I had so many plans set for this month but now they are all ruined. I was planning on having a birthday celebration next week, might not even do that anymore. I really wish he told me the week of or just a few days before but now the suspense is killing me. I am not a normal person. I know other people do not like jury duty either but they just suck it up and do it anyway. Ever since I found out last night, I have been taking depressive naps and I think I am in a depressive episode because I have not been able to smile or do anything that brings me joy. It just stays in the back of my head 24/7. Like I said, I am not normal. I have major anxiety especially when it comes to government-related stuff. Obviously I do not do anything against the law, I abide by it so its not like I am worried about being convicted or anything like that. Its just that when it comes to the DMV or Jury Duty or the TSA or anything like that, you are expected to know everything and know what to say and where to go and when to speak and what hand to raise and all that. If you do not, you look like the outcast and typically everyone else knows. It does not help that the employees are normally rude as fuck which gives me even more anxiety. Right now its on standby but I guarantee if I do get called to go, I am going to be at the wrong stand at the wrong time or I am not going to speak when they ask me to or I am going to accidentally speak when they were asking someone else. And then they will slam the gavel down, yell at me for contempt of court or something like that. Its not like a line at Starbucks where if you accidentally cut it, the barista will calmly tell you where the line starts. Perfection and flawlessness is expected in government-related stuff, which gives me stress since I am flawed and imperfect. I asked one of my friends how he got out of it (he told me his fiance will help him get out of it) a couple months ago. He said he did not get picked. While honest, he then did not give me any reassurance and said that they make it nearly impossible for people my age (mid-20s) to get out of it. I have checked Reddit and literally all of the advice is either silly or somewhat serious but still requires you to be there regardless no email or anything like that.My mom who was angry at my dad for picking the worst time to tell me the news is now yelling at me and mad at me for being depressed. she is just telling me to not be weak.Getting out of it is looking to be impossible according to friends, family and the Internet. I have no one on my side to give me reassurance during this extremely difficult time. I have a job that requires me to do constant work and this week was actually a relaxing week since my boss was not in for most of it, and I just had to find out this horrible news during this difficult week. I am almost done with all of my coursework for this semester but now there is no incentive for me to do it as efficiently as before since the jury duty date will be during my break. I really wish I did not know until a few days or even a week before. Life just feels like never ending stress to me. So I am hoping I can get out of it by just not being alive. that would be great.

{"id": "10955", "text": "18, M. Let me just get straight into it.For the past 3 months now, every time I pass my window, I am almost 100% certain someone is watching me and it stresses me out and makes me anxious. I feel watched inside my room - almost like people can see through the wall. But it does not stop there. I feel spied by the government every time I use an electronic device and that they are plotting against me. I have blocked my camera with something, which has helped a bit, but I still feel like they are listening to my thoughts through the camera somehow. When I am alone in my room, I sometimes sense another presence. And it does not stop there.I do not trust many of my friends. I believe some of them are masters at manipulation and I am too socially inexperienced to detect it. I 'read' things hidden messages in casual conversations at times. When I say goodbye to them, my first thought is that they are talking behind my back, and it makes me question whether I should stop hanging out with them. Sometimes, it becomes too much, so I end accusing them of manipulation/lies and become aggressive. Of course, they are in complete denial. This is where I start to question whether any of my thoughts are real. I cannot trust my own thoughts, but I do not trust the words of others either. These thoughts pop up every day out of nowhere. They are so intrusive and inescapable that I just want to die because the anguish is unbearable. It is like my thoughts are disturbed and incohesive. I then wake up the next day, unable to recognize any of my beliefs and thoughts from the night before. My thoughts also are not disturbed or incohesive; they are somewhat normal again.FYI, I have been diagnosed with Aspergers and BPD, but this does not resemble any of my diagnoses. I am feeling suicidal because of it and I just got checked out from the psychiatry a week ago after being hospitalized for two weeks. I told them about my paranoia, but they did not really seem to acknowledge it, which I do not get at all. All they gave me is another diagnosis (Aspergers)..

My parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but I know they love me so I try to not put it against them. So my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. Thing is, after COVID restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. I was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. I failed most of my classes both semesters. I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. They are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. I do not know if they will find out I failed this year or not, but either way I feel that I am such a horrible child, even if I cannot help my mental illness I could have reached out. I do not even want to go to college anymore. I do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, I want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans.

On the other hand, it also surprisingly increased my general anxiety, I am not happy or sad, I just feel stressed all the time. I have developed skin picking but on my head, which had lead to hair loss.I also do not feel pleasure the same.. sorry to give personal details, but it is the best example to describe this absorbing pleasure effect. When I reach the point of having an orgasm, the wave of pleasure (like the best part of it at the end) just brutally stop. So frustrating.I have tried to stop it last month by decreasing my intakes.

{"id": "7494", "text": "I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon", "class": "Suicidal"}

Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem.

Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this.

{"id": "17977", "text": "My husband has a ton of his own problems, and has been very suicidal in the past (actual attempts), mostly before I knew him, but he has been threatening suicide since I have known him. There is a bunch of complicated reasons for everything here, but I am not going to go into details. We have a 5 year old daughter. She was not planned, and we were not married. He is not an involved parent. I am basically a single parent. I take my daughter to visit family often. When we are home, he does not spend any significant time with her and he has never done any caretaking. He blames his lack of involvement on the fact that we are often away, and then on his own mental health problems. He blames me for everything.This morning my daughter was screaming and hitting me and coming after me because I said no to something she wanted. I left the room and went into the room he was \"sleeping\" in. I put it in quotes because he was trying to just sleep through all of it, though there was no way anyone could have. I asked for some help. Like, just some backup, someone else to come in and just say no and hold the boundary because she was physically coming after me. We DO NOT physically punish our daughter and try not to even yell. He got up angrily and berated me for not being able to \"defend myself against a toddler.\" I figured at that point that I had made the wrong choice involving him but I could never have guessed what was coming. We got to the bedroom door that she had slammed and locked. I was bending down and picking up the key thing that had fallen off the door frame to unlock the door, when he just grabbed the door handle and slammed his shoulder into the door, breaking through. The force was like when police bust through doors in movies, and it all happened so fast.My daughter was standing RIGHT in front of the door on the other side. Like, holding the handle, when he did this. The door knob hit her in the forehead with unimaginable force, and she went flying backwards over some stupid wooden rocking horse that was by the door. I have never in my life been so shocked and scared and angry, I could not believe what had just happened. I ran through the door, immediately picked her up and brought her to the bed and just held her while we both cried hysterically. I know that parents are supposed to stay calm when injuries and things happen but I just could not in this situation I was basically hyperventilating I was crying so hard. He immediately started minimizing what had just happened. Arguing semantics when I screamed \"why would you break the door down?\" (Saying \"I did not break it down, I broke through\" - like, big difference??) And then almost blaming her for standing by the door when no one could have predicted what he was going to do, especially her. You cannot see through a door, and you should just assume someone might get hurt if you break through it with no warning. Kept calling it an accident, and while I understand that it was not the same thing as walking up to her and punching her in the face, he still made an angry, violent choice with no regard for her safety. He also kept saying it was nothing compared to what would happen to him at his parents' hands, like that somehow makes this better, or less damaging.A nurse advice line was called. She is not showing signs of concussion. But what the actual fuck. I do not feel like I can forgive this. I started packing up. I feel like I need to get my daughter away. Like permanently. I admit that in my immediate shock, anger and fear I was screaming things at him like, \"do not touch her!\" And \"we are done, we are never coming back here!\" So after things calmed down a bit, he started what I knew was coming. He started deflecting all sorts of things in all sorts of ways - he all but accused my parents and me of beating her when she gets normal bruises and scrapes from playing/tripping while running, etc. \"because he does not know what we are capable of and he is not there to see.\" And he said that whenever I lose my temper and yell at her it is arguably worse and more traumatizing to her than \"this one mistake.\" Next he started saying that he will wait til August but he is just going to kill himself. Because of all the reasons, but especially now because I am basically saying we are gone and this life is over now. I understand that suicide is not inherently selfish, but can you imagine being a little girl who got a severe head wound when her dad bust through her door in a fit of anger, felt at fault for standing there in the first place, and then a couple weeks later, her dad kills himself after basically telling her that this \"accident\" is the reason why? she is not a baby, she will remember this, but she is also not an adult who could separate his existing problems and not blame herself. So I am completely frozen. All I want to do is get away from him, but I know that if I do, the chances of him actually killing himself skyrocket. there is no one to call for him. All I could do is get the authorities involved and have him committed or something. I am also afraid to go to my family and tell them what happened. I cannot lie, I cannot teach her to hide what actually happened, that would be terribly damaging. But when I tell them, it is all over. They already have issues with him but they put up with him because he is her dad. They sometimes voice fear about us going home and ask if he would ever hurt us. I have never had reason to believe that he would, but now all of that is changed and there is no going back, whether this was a mistake or not. He will not be welcome at their house anymore, and they will not allow us to come back here.I feel like this is completely my fault. I should have just given her what she wanted before it turned into a tantrum. I should have never involved him. If I had not said no to her and then gotten him involved, none of this would have happened! She would not have gotten hurt in this awful way, and he would not be threatening to kill himself over it. It is my fault.I have no idea what to do. I tried to open a crisis chat a bunch of times before I made this post but I got too scared that they would be like mandated reporters or something, be able to track us down, and that would just make everything worse at this moment in time.

I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior.

She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said \"I love you\" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do.

But I been dealing with some anxiety for as long as I could remember but whenever I get into a relationship with anyone it seems to heighten my anxiety. I am currently in a relationship with this incredible person (or that is what he portrays to me at least). He cooks for me, cleans, really does everything that a boyfriend should do. But I am always getting these voices in my head telling me hes cheating, hes not actually into me, hes waiting for someone better, just playing with my emotions, hes things from me and plenty more scenarios that play over in my head. All these things might not be true but its hard to get past the voices in my head but its hard for me to just tell myself that its me overthinking everything and just worrying over nothing. Hes always reinsuring me that he wants to be with me and he would not be with me if he did not want to be here . But I been with horrible guys in the past that did horrible things to me and want to blame them for why I am like this, but it gets to a point to where I have to look at myself and say its me and my mental health. Here an example of the most recent thing:I was getting out the shower and came out of the room and I noticed he was sad and I proceeded to ask him what is wrong and hes tells me hes having some family drama but hes okay, so I proceeded to give him a hug but I am the back of my head I am thinking maybe someone he was talking to broke up with him and hes sad, hes not happy being with me, or he wants to end things but scared to because he will hurt my feelings. He barely tells me anything about he so I assume hes hiding things from me. I am always the one telling him things about me. Its like hes closed off. But he says hes wants to be with me and have kids.Also he has this thing where he said he would never post me on his social media because hes a private person, so my friends and family are the only people that knows about us and I just feel like someone hes hiding me, so i feel like he does not like me. He tells me that my friends and family should be enough and I should not worry about anyone else knowing. It could be because hes not out yet but I would love to be for people to know about me on his social media. But to sum everything up I looking for advice on how to stop the voices and just be happy with the guy I am with.

In terms of medication nothing really ever helps, they often tried to beat whatever just came up with neuroleptics or antidepressants and they only thing that ever helped was putting myself to sleep with benzos, which is not something my Psychiatrist is willing to give me that often.

{"id": "14996", "text": "really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong, and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing/ glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool, but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again, i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good, how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all, but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said completely false things (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent most of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues, knowing what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself.

I am screwed . How can i expect to study at a much higher effieciency and pace when i do not have the motivation and energy to do anything other than just lying at one place feeling completely awful. How can i not being yelled at without stressing out too much when the slightest form of criticism can makes me feel hurt, humiliated and question my own self-worth. I would probably fail the test. And the build up to that failure will be those ongoing stressful days that torments me every second. Sure i will struggle to put some effort in studying but it will make no difference. I think i will kill myself in process of cramming in the rush period when there is not much time left because by that time my guilt and fear for failing and being a burden to my parents as well as my hopelessness would be too intensive for me to live with. School starts about a month later, still online classes due to Covid-19. But i can feel like everything is start falling apart right now.( I am sorry if this post is all too personal and you cannot relate anything to , and please forgive my bad English, I am just a learner ) I do not think i can make it through this last year in high school", "class": "Suicidal"}

In 1 week I have to leave my home and city that I have called home for the last 20 years. No one is helping me pack or clean and tbh I would probably refuse any that a offered because I would not want anyone to see what has turned into a hoard as a result of my depression. I have been living in squalor. I have a plans and the technical tools i need to execute the cleanup and move but all I have been doing for three days is crying. This eviction is super personal and has forced me to face things about loved ones and myself that i was not prepared to do. The amount of grief, anger, and fear I am feeling is overwhelming and totally paralyzing me. If I cannot get my place cleaned up its going to make my current issues 10 times bigger. I need an off switch, or at least a pause button so I can get what i need done. Are there any tools /strategies that can help me let go of Or at least temporarily stuff these feelings so that I can get what I need to get done?I should note that I am being diligent about basic self-care such as eating, hydrating, and sleeping so you can skip those bits.Any and all tips are very much appreciated, I am drowning over here, thanks.

I truly believe that everything would be better if I just got put into foster care and got to move far away from here.&amp;#x200B;Also apparently I have my behavior has gotten worse even tho I think it has gotten better. According to my mom I have become cruel and mean, but I do not think so.&amp;#x200B;But now since everyone is so concerned about me why will not they do anything? Why will not they take me to a therapist or atleast recommend me going to one? I would definitely be open to it. I just want to tell my parents that it is OKAY to ask other people for help and not be so selfish. Everyone thinks there is something wrong with me.", "class": "Depression"}

I explain my worries and how I feel useless, then later, I tell him I wanted to get food from downstairs with him. I wanted some food to ease my anxiety. I ask him if he was hungry. He tells me no, then I quickly change my decision bc I did not want to make him go down with me if he was not going to eat. He snaps at me and tells me hates when I get like this. I ask him if he was annoyed w me. He tells me yes, bc you are not like this and you would normally go down for food if you were not feeling so anxious. I get extremely saddened by what he said, I think because I was already not feeling so good and him saying that made my tears well up. I get quiet and look away because I did not want to choke on my tears. He asks me what is wrong and why I am not saying anything and he sounded more annoyed when I was quiet and shaky with my responses. I just wish he would be empathetic rather than trying to fix things and be logical all the time. How hard is it to give someone a hug and comfort them and tell them everything will be okay.

I feel like no ones really noticed and the ones i do tell just seem confused because I am not physically hurting myself, I am not crying all the time or lashing out like i normally do when it gets bad. But this is the worst I have felt in a long time. I do not even know why I am sad, and it turns into frustration and then anger and then hopelessness. One thing that maybe is not helping is my personal relationships. I am taking a break from romantic things as i had a failed talking stage fairly recently, and even though he and i only talked for a brief period of time and its been a while since i cut things off i cannot get over it. Its affected me way more than it should. I also feel like I am pushing my friends away without even trying. I am not myself right now and i know they can sense it. I do not think I am as fun to be around, if I ever even was. This is the first time I have been this alone. I feel like without a person to swoon over or focus on I am just an empty she will. I know i need to be alone and work on myself, but i feel so stuck. I feel horrible but i cannot cry, I cannot even express how i feel to people and i do not think anyone understands just how terribly hopeless this feeling is.

But now, my brain just feels so blurry, and all I can think about is how useless I am in comparison to everyone else around me. The world just does not feel quite as real, either. I know that everything around me is real, but I just do not feel as connected to it before as I used to. I think that is also why I cannot think as clearly or deeply anymore, because nothing seems to matter as much. I just want to know if anyone else feels similarly I feel like I cannot think clearly anymore", "class": "Depression"}

College was easy for me, but not anymore. I feel dumb, I forget things very easily and everything seems foggy. I use to be extremely perfectionist with my classes and not be able to get the results I want anymore is just frustrating. This makes me feel depressed, because even before this problem started, my life was not as good as I would want, this just made me even consider suicide. I even tried two times, but I did not succeed. I am incompetent even for thatI know that I should look for professional help, but that is the problem. Its like, on the one hand I know that I need help but on the other hand I do not want it. I do not know how to properly explain that , and yeah, I know, it is pretty stupid. Maybe is the fear to be judged, or maybe I already became insane, who knows. Look, I do not have many friends to talk, and the few that I do I do not think they will understand. My parents, well They do not know about this. I still have a little of contact with them, but I am not sure if it could be a good idea tell them this, because I do not want to because them more problems.

I have had no life. None. No rights no hobby no freetime no social interaction. Was just forced to study 24/7 to become a doctor. My grandparents would not even let me to groom my hair properly or wear perfumes because that would attract girls! I had never met or talked to a girl for my intire life till I was in university and that obviously turned out terrible. I have so many personality issues and find it hard to properly socialize with anyone. I got into med school in another city expecting to finally start living a normal life and having my basic rights. All those promises my family had made that they would finally let me be free or the things they are going to get me if I get into med school but suddenly my rich narc family stopped paying for my basic needs like even enough to buy proper food! Or to pay for my taxi! Let alone hanging out with friends or getting a girlfriend. They said money will spoil you! You will get busy with girls and not finish your studies!! I wanted to take my driving license and they replied the same :) I tolerated that hellish situation for 4 months but after that quit. It was not that easy they still argue/fight with me to this day. 2 years have gone by and I am stuck in my room with nothing much to do but making the days pass 24/7 on my phone or watching movies.

I realized through the online friends I made that I am not the problem. The Islamic system is. I could easily connect with people and even girls not only romantically but on a human level and make true connection but here the restrictions and rules have made our girls kind of weird and too hard to catch. Like until 2 or 3 years ago being caught just walking with your girlfriend on the street would have ended up with 100 lashes and execution in the 4th trial. Iran is like a big cemetary. we are not allowed to sing/dance or date. it is like happiness is forbidden. walking on the streets is like there is dust of death everywhere.

I would say I have had major depression (not medically diagnosed) for about 2 months now, but its been slowly growing over the course of 6 months when I could still function. I moved from East to West coast of the US and thought I would be fine when I moved. However the past 2 months of living alone has been extremely tough on me.I have days where I have some semblance of \"normalcy\" where I can cook/prepare meals, clean, etc (do stuff I need to). But most days as of lately are just me sulking about my life situation and I barely have enough energy to even get out of bed or stand up. So its those odd days that still keep me going. Overall I have been having incredible feelings of **dread**, **hopelessness**, and **aimlessness**.**Dread** because I have had this idea in my head of how I want to live my life, but nothing is the way I want it. After college I wanted to move abroad and live in an rural foresty area. But, currently I still live in the US and live in an urban desert (Arizona). I strongly feel like I **do not belong here** but I accepted the job anyways since I need experience out of college. I hate cities, hate the heat, and hate driving; all things I have to deal with.**Hopelessness** because I have many things I want to do and improve on. But cannot get myself to do them; creating an endless cycle of berating myself. I distract myself with YouTube, video games, and talking with friends; which makes me temporarily happy but when I stop and realize where I am, I just break down.**Aimlessness** because I do not know what to do with myself. Even though I am working in a company that has nice and helpful co-workers/managers; I just do not care about the work and am only planning to stay here for 3 years to get experience. However, the 2 months I have been here the longer days feel. I thought I would make friends at work but am not putting in effort in making them, and so put myself in a lonely situation.I tried looking for therapy after I got insurance from my company but all have waiting lists since they are completely booked.

I am asking what I should do as I cannot live with the fact I did this especially as I was already suicidal.I went out with friends and invited a friend I met on a dating app that I had known previously and was in town visiting, we got drunk and since she drove I told her she could stay at my place, prior to this night I had recently reconnected with friends after disappearing for months during a mental health episode and things looked up for once.This Is where I completely fuck up and I cannot believe I did this. After drinking with some friends at my place we cuddle and put on a movie, we were all over each the entire night prior to being drunk too, she specifically told me she did not want to have sex because she was going through a lot and recently attempted, I genuinely wanted to respect that and not make her uncomfortable so at this time I accepted nothing would happen although I did hope in the back of my head something would. We were cuddling and she told me she would take off her shirt because it was hot, I told her I understand and that I did not want to make her do anything she did not want to (although in the end I did). She then said that that makes her want to do it more (have sex) and I insisted I did not want to make her do anything she is uncomfortable with I should have stopped everything here in retrospect but given I was also intoxicated but its not an excuse. She layed on me and I played with her chest we then told each other some pretty vulnerable stuff like how I am a virgin.She said things like I cannot believe someone as handsome and amazing as you has not been with anyone etc. I told her I have a lot of trauma that made me shy around girls. I am not entirely sure what happened next but we made out a little and she ended up laying over my legs on her stomach I assumed she wanted to watch the movie. I began touching her more aggressively and took off her underwear the entire time I did not realize she was passed out asleep I thought she may have closed her eyes because as I touched her more intimately (but never putting anything inside her) she started to breath heavier. In hindsight should have not took this as consent. I stopped to get up, and saw her eyes were closed so I put a blanket over her it still did not click what I had done.She then asked a couple seconds after tucking her in why she had no underwear. I immediately realized what I had done was not consensual I started to apologize the best I could while intoxicated. But she was still half asleep. After apologizing profusely and waking her up she became very empathetic telling me that it was okay and she will not tell anyone and that I did not know she was asleep. I tried to tell her that it does not matter what I did was fucked up but somehow ended up with her embracing me and encouraging me to talk about the trauma I mentioned to her earlier so I did it was weirdly therapeutic and I was so confused because I just did something horrible to her.She ended up sobering up and to my protest she drove and I bought her food and told her how sorry I was agin and if there was anything I can do let me know before she dropped me back at my place. I stupidly texted her after not sleeping at all that She should let me take her on a proper date because she said she wanted to see each other before she left town I know I am a stupid idiot but I texted her that, she obviously declined and I knew she felt differently than when it initially what happened as she was probably sobering up and processing what happened.I told her I understand and that it was selfish of me to ask. She then sent me a longer text later in the day and it was that she felt violated and that I took advantage of her which I absolutely did. Despite that She told me that she genuinely thinks I am a good friend and hopes I thrive one day and get help but that she has to block me for her own mental health. I replied with a really long apology that I hope was sincere and understanding but it did not go through as I was expecting.I am not sure what to do now I have been a mess the entire day, I feel so fucking horrible for what I did its eating me alive.

My dad had a heart attack and had decent insurance, but he still owed $60,000 after he got out of the hospital and then he had to work three jobs to stay out of bankruptcy. He worked like a dog until he was 80 and lost his sight. For decades, he had a much weaker heart, but was having to work three times harder to keep his head above water financially. Also...therapy is exceedingly expensive. My oldest sister has spent roughly $20,000 on therapy over the years and...honestly...she is not any better and in some ways she is much worse. Even if the therapy was somewhat beneficial, the weight of the debt you owe counteracts any good that might have come from the process. I went to a place called..5 palms..in Florida. I admitted myself and was there for an intensive emotional rehab course that was supposed to last a month. Well...the insurance stated that they were only going to cover 2weeks. So...I left after 2 weeks and thought that was the end of it. However, they lied to me when they said that all I needed to pay was $3,000 up front and the insurance would cover the rest. After I got back and started feeling better, they sent me a very unexpected additional fee of over $6,000. Immediately, I went into a panic and all the initial benefit and healing that I received from 5 palms completely vanished. Actually...because of that huge additional bill, I was worse off emotionally than when I went in. I was so stressed out because now I owed over $6,000 and I had previously given them $3,000 in the beginning...that was a surprise and was not shared with me until I was already back home. I felt used and abused. I felt preyed on, as a person that desperately needed mental health support. They took advantage of me. They truly did not care about me. They only wanted to push me through the system like a cattle drive and reap the revenue from screwing me over... yet another helpless person. If you do not have money, you cannot eat. You cannot have a decent roof over your head and unfortunately, if you want to have a real chance of being loved, you absolutely have to have your finances in order or nobody will want anything to do with you. In order to be respected, you need money. If you want health (emotional or physical), you need money. If you want good nutrition, you need money. The list is endless. Even if you ask someone to help you move, they want payment of some kind (money, beer, pizza...etc). They never want to help you out of the goodness of their heart. If you do not have a way to compensate them, they just come up with excuse after excuse as to why they are not available. Unfortunately, you grow up in a world that teaches you that YOU \"personally\" are worthless as a human being unless you have money. that is the subliminal brain washing tactic.that eats away at your soul and before long, you are extremely depressed and feel so low about yourself. You become worthless, unwanted and very lonely... all because you do not worship \"money\"...the masses are fooled by this mindset and it really only benefits the top 1% of americans anyway (we are all mindless cattle under the finger of the mega rich). If you DO succumb to the deceitful thought process, that money is a God of sorts, then you might be able to do more things and seemingly have more fun, but deep down you are slaving away for cash, as your only means of self worth, and you just feel like a machine. Money only gives you false security and fake friends...and you know that deep inside. You work extra hard for more ways to entertain yourself and keep your mind occupied. So...whether you have money or not, it is a double edged sword. If you do not have it, you are lost...and...if you do have it (and your not in the 1% club), you are lost...but yet everyone is clambering to get their hands on more and more of it. Millions of people die in wars, murder, hunger and even endure human trafficing because \"someone\" wants money and will do absolutely anything to get it. The mind is a very peculiar thing. It will devise ways to covertly try and avoid the catastrophic things that are right in your face and dim the brilliance of the red flags flying all around you for mere survival sake. You begin to play mind games with yourself just to barely function. I feel like Neo, in the original Matrix movie. I took the red pill and the vale has been lifted on society for what it really is. I absolutely despise money. I hate it so much. I would burn all of it, if it was within my power. There needs to be a better way. Society has been brainwashed for centuries and this is just how life is now. Money rules everything. People will totally sell their soul for it because it has become the ONLY focal point on the horizon. They will spend all their time working at the office and let their children raise themselves or allow them to be raised by other means...(TV, internet, movies...etc). Society is so screwed up and we all know it. We cannot look it straight in the face and fully admit how bad it is. it is very similar to \"death denial\". Everyone knows they are going to die someday, but cannot truly admit that. Coming face to face with the fact that you are going to die...without a doubt...is mentally traumatizing. The same goes with the way society is NOW. We all know that it is extremely screwed up and beyond recovery. However, we cannot fully admit that because it would be too mentally traumatizing. Thanks for reading this. I appreciate the time and energy you spent and again...thank you. $$ .. MONEY .. $$", "class": "Depression"}

I get along with everyone and I am usually perceived as the funny happy-go-lucky guy who is always smiling and even though this used to be true, it just is not anymore. I was diagnosed with depression this spring and now I am wondering if there is anyone out there in a similar situation?It started a while back as a feeling of emptiness and I started feeling like there was a hole inside me that would not go away no matter what I did so after a couple of months I decided to get checked out and surprise surprise I was depressed lmao. Ever since life has felt like a sort of blur. I get out of bed, go to work, see my friends, usually smoke some weed to ease the feeling of hopelessness(which I have btw gotten kind of addicted to recently) and then I go to bed just to repeat it all the next day. Its not like I go around feeling sad all day I just feel kind of grey, like there is something inside me that is missing.For a while I have really been trying my best to fight it, I try to hang with my friends, I go to bed fairly early, I workout and I am seeing a therapist but it just does not seem to be working. Id be super grateful any tips guy guys have and it would feel great ti know that I am not alone:) Anyone like me out there?", "class": "Depression"}

I also think I have a low self esteem issue because I always find myself putting myself down and feel like I can never get a girlfriend because no one would want me. there is no specific reason why I feel sad and like shit it just comes and goes. It especially got worse as I am 19 barely out of high school and I have no idea what to do with my life and feel like everyone around me expects me to know. I love my dad and hes always been a great father, but he suffers from alcohol addiction and refuses to admit it and talk about it. He will not seek help no matter how much I ask him to and its starting to really affect my health too. Hes said some very messed up stuff to me while drunk like I am worthless and I will not amount to anything. This really makes me feel worse because he is self made and successful and I feel like what hes saying is true. I feel like hes not proud of me even when sober he says he is but when hes drunk he says things that make me feel like shit. I have thought many times how all my problems could go away and how easy it would be to just end it but I am too scared to even go through with it.

I have been battling depression for 10 years now and STILL not only contemplate but more often than Id like to admit think about suicide. what is keeping me from doing it? My kid that is it, the selfishness it would be to leave her w out a father. I have got no parental support system, my relationship with my BM/fianc has been on the rocks and losing my job has sort of pushed me to think about it more and more. Anti depressants are not working like they used to, I am tired of being medicated at such a young age. I often think maybe my fianc and kid would be better off with out me. there is something about depression that I have only realized the past 5 years and that is that it literally takes over everything in you. Your sex drive, your motivation to get up everyday, your motivation to play with your kids. My thoughts tend to go to the gutter and think wow what if my kid gets this depression just like I have got? Do I have something to do w that considering as how it runs in my side of the family? How do you continue going on everyday w out the urge to just leave this earth? I have got a whole human that depends on me.. why do my thoughts always go back to killing myself?

Thank you in advance to those who comment. :) Long-story-short, I feel trapped in unfulfilling office jobs that do not align with who I am as a person. Every day I go through some sort of existential crisis, and lately I have really been wondering what the purpose of life is. On top of this, USA's economic and societal climate really makes me depressed. Jobs I would *actually* be happy with would not pay a livable wage. Cost of living is too damn high, and greed is so rampant amongst corporations/rich people. Anyway, I have been working in my \"professional\" career for about 7 years now, but I still feel like a scared little girl when it comes to taking on responsibilities and talking to other people. All the information that comes my way at work does not stick. I do not have interest in retaining it, and it is really starting to bite me in the butt. My career motivation is tanked, and I feel very guilty about it - I know this is not who I really I am... Seriously, I can be a very driven and happy person! But especially lately I really just want to shut myself away. I want to quit, but bills need to be paid!So my question is: **how do I get out of this rutt and find fulfillment?** I have tried therapy, anti-depressants, career coaches, exercising, and eating well. I have also changed jobs a couple times, gone back to school for Master's, etc. But over time I sink back to these bad feelings. **How can I gain confidence in my job and skills? What will make me WANT to wake up everyday?** I miss the feeling of \"the world is my oyster\". The world is shit. Advise on Fulfillment?", "class": "Suicidal"}

{"id": "13854", "text": "Hi all,(24/F)I have been taking 30mg of nortriptyline since 2015 for general anxiety and to help with some depression/sleep issues. It has worked pretty well for me, no complaints. I have not loved the fact that I cannot drink alcohol much (it just intensifies it a lot) but other than that I have been able to sleep great and my anxiety/depression has been under control the past 6ish years. However, I am finding it not to be as effective anymore; I am not sure why, but my anxiety is back lately (fluttery feeling constantly, just general anxiety for a lot of the days) with nothing really provoking it - nothing worrying me or anything anxiety inducing in particular. Lately I have found it extremely hard to wake up and get out of bed in the mornings, and I cannot really drink caffeine either, so most mornings I am up around 9:30 and just feel super tired for a good part of the morning.I am considering switching to Celexa/citalopram- my boyfriend and sister are both on it and they seem to really like it. My only concern is that it will affect my sleep - I hear it can make it hard to fall asleep/stay asleep. Another concern is tapering off nortriptyline while introducing a new medication at the same time. I am going to talk to my doctor this week about it, but just wondered if anyone has any insight on switching or going off nortriptyline. Any advice would be appreciated!

When I was at college before university during my 2 year course, I was so motivated, went in on my day off, did every bit of work and got straight A'sI've lost interest in most things.

I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now. Except my brain is so stupid. I feel so stupid, I cannot remember anything, or focus on anything for any amount of time. Not only that, but I am also terrified of saying something stupid, or looking like an idiot. To be fair to myself it takes years to learn a language, but I have such a thin skin right now. Yesterday I went for a walk around my neighborhood. It was actually the first time I walked around it in a long time. Nearing the end of it I got whacked in the face by a bee, jumped, swatted it. Right in front another person. I felt ridiculous, like I was swatting at nothing like a crazy person. Trying to save I face I remarked that \"I hate bees\" with an awkward laugh. She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day. And I keep thinking that I am never going to do it. I am worried about it being another regret in my life. I could have done it but never did. Just another causulty of my depression.I want to go on more hikes. I want a friend to do it with. I love walking but I do not like going on walks by myself. I am still nervous about it, and honestly it is better having someone there with you. I do not want to talk the entire time, but it would be nice to have company while strolling along and listening to music.Speaking of music. I have so many albums on backlog that I have not listened to yet. I want to listen to them, but I like listening to new albums the whole way through on the first go. So I save them until I am \"ready\" and \"have enough time to thoroughly enjoy them\", but that never happens even though a majority of my time is spend in my room doing nothing. I have not learned to drive yet. I have tried and I am scared. I feel like my anxiety is going to because me to over react and because an accident. it would be great to drive, then maybe I could go out and do things. But the thing is that not driving should not be holding me back this much. I do not need to drive where I live. Sure, it would make life easier, but there are plenty of busses or Ubers and even trains that I could take into the city if I wanted. But I do not. I go to work, I do some schoolwork, then I sleep and maybe I will eat if I am lucky while convincing myself that maybe next week things will change.My last semester of college is going be this fall and I feel like my entire world is crumbling because I do not know what I am going to do when it ends.I am overwhelmed, and I am bitter and irritable and angry and judgemental all of the time.

Saying if you look at for peoples thoughts, way of acting, needs and such; you are not emphasizing with them you are experiencing trauma. It kind of hit me, I just feel quite anxious these days, not only looking out for peoples expressions and pretty much I feel paranoid about what people feel or think about me. I have gained weight these days and my family just like to slap it to my face, making fun of me mirroring their inferiority. Which worked actually. I just am so ducking tired of trying to give weight, even I do not really want to, I am literally having thoughts about what if I was fit like a model, I do not look the best anyway, maybe if I have a fit body, and such thoughts. Every ducking minute while I am on social media, I see ya think being woman is easy videos. I indeed liked myself yet people in those things comments just keep apologizing for what they have been through. I apologize that happened to you, that just so sad. I now keep looking out for someone staring at me, what if they desire me but I am underage, my hair, my clothes, shorts I want to wear but what my family thinks what other people think, just everything. I just feel anxious. My parent even try to say bad things about me sleeping half naked, what if a burglar were to come, going out and what if someone we know sees your outfits. Be considerate we like like you, we want to protect you. My country is just so ducking in bad state that i feel like I might get assaulted or die anytime. Feminists? They are just obsessed with how they are addressed, I do not call myself feminists not because I hate woman, first its name is just stepped on already and I think in order to qualify as woman you need to be doing something not sitting on your ass replying to not all my comments. I have yet to meet any active feminist. In a very sexist place I just have these thoughts what if I wear what I wantDo I have to do this because I am a womanI do not fell safe anymoreIm tired of my lifeIm tired of always thinking about who looks at my fat ass, who wants to kill me, who hates meIm just tired of seeing All assaulted woman making me feel like there is no way I can resist.I am just tired of being compared to peoples standards I like you, but I think you would look better if you were thin said my momI just want to be alone do my chores because they are mine not because I could do both. I just feel inferior, I really do want abs but the moment I said I want to workout of course my mom told me I am a girl, I want 6 pack I said I want to be fit again and then she said okay. Why do I need to be this suppressed and oppressed and at the same to need to cope with my future how shit economy is going. I just want freedom, and equality. I am just ducking tired. Sometimes I just understand it and be so null, and like a wave these daily problems just hit so bad. Like a wave", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "16577", "text": "I was first prescribed SSRIs when I was 8 years old. I was poorly adjusted at a charity boarding school in eastern Vermont. I had what could be described as behavioral issues. I was sent to the school by my uncle after my mother and father had been sent to Federal prison following convictions of conspiracy to traffic controlled substances in 1998.I did poorly with my school work despite intense remedial tutoring. I had difficulty socializing with my peers in a respectful and productive manner. I was always in trouble.I was removed from the residential school in December of 2000 and taken off my medication when my behavior became too disruptive and the treatments for these behaviors became ineffective.I was to attend a public school my grandmother's hometown in Southern New Hampshire. I lasted there no more than 2 weeks before I was asked to stop coming while the school district would draft an IEP and send me to a biological education facility.I was sent the following school year to a school for kids a broad range mental health issues.I was there from 2001 to 2006. It was like an alternative school the teachers were specifically trained in crisis response and non-invasive restraints.I was to attend monthly hour-long meetings with a psychotherapist employed by the school. Overtime I learned to regulate my behavior but the mood disorder never went away.I had never gotten passing grades in school and saw no future there so I dropped out at age 16 and got an equivalents diploma. I had no direction as a teenager no goals no guidance. Still mentally ill. Still no solution.When I turned 18 I joined the army I had to do a lot of lying to get in. I should not have passed my eye acuity exam due to having an exotropic strabismus (crooked eyes) I figured out how to cheat the tests. The army specifically does not let you join if you have history of mental illness. I scored well on my ASVAB and chose the MOS 68W Medic.I struggled through basic training, for the same reasons I struggled in school. Despite not having depth perception and double vision after six attempts I qualified as sharpshooter to pass basic. The physical demands also took me longer than most people in my unit. I did complete basic training without remediation.I was then sent Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio Texas for combat medic school.It was the hardest thing I have ever done. I passed all my qualifying tests first time despite seeing so many fail out of the school.I was then sent to my unit.there is a good reason the army does not want mentally ill in their ranks. I had to find out the hard way. I did poorly in my unit for the same reasons I had struggled at everything in my life up to that point. I was chaptered out after 2 years a month in jail and a suicide attempt.Coming out of the military I had never really held a real job in my life. I found that I struggled in a working environment consistently. I could not and still cannot keep a job for more than a year. I become cynical nihilistic and agitated I suppose it is because I lack meaning and purpose. In October of 2014 five strangers broken into my home and nearly beat me to death over a roommates drug debt. I had no dog in that fight.

I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.I have had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I have recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I am afraid to trust anyone, so I have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I am not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down. And I have dropped hints everywhere that I want support but nobody ever noticed. Even going to a therapist is hard because I do not trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how I am feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents hand. And I do not trust my parents with a single atom in my body. Because some part of teenage me does not trust adults. Because I do not want anyone to worry about me, because in the end this is my burden to carry.So yeah. I have been contemplating suicide. I have even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people I have once felt even remotely close to trusting. I have been getting no sleep at all lately.

I am supposed to start work at what I am told is a very good job in September. It was a very competitive position and, to my everlasting shame, I outcompeted a great number of people far more dedicated and motivated than myself simply because they did not possess the same talent for education and testing. I ought to have pursued something more mediocre to begin with, or maybe nothing at all, given that I will be a rotting corpse by September either way. What a waste.I have moved my dad's Glock 19 from his dresser into mine, and I doubt that he will notice its missing before the gunshot. Right now the sole object of my life consists in building up the courage to point it towards my head. Once I am able to do that, I assume the act of pulling the trigger will be relatively easy. To my mind, overcoming the subconscious instinct of survival by an act of conscious will might be the single most significant act of individuality it is possible for a person to undertake. that is probably not true, but I believe it anyway, since it provides an air of dignity to what is fundamentally a cowardly and disgusting action. And if I am doing it either way, what difference does it make whether I dignify it or torture myself by calling it what it is? I have grown tired of torturing myself. Although the recognition of this logical inconsistency is really self torture in its own right.I am sure my suicide will seem absolutely ridiculous to everyone I know. My life appears to be going perfectly. I just visited a good friend of mine in another state for a week, and in that entire time did not tell him anything of these feelings. I have not told my family either, or any of my other friends. I just cannot stand the thought of them actually trying to help me, actually trying to \"be there\" for me and comfort me. The thought of their empathy makes me sick to my stomach. They really have nothing to offer me, and if they did try to help me I would have to pretend that they actually were, to avoid hurting them more. The last time someone gave me the old, useless platitudes of \"things will get better\" and \"people love you\" I wanted to laugh in his face, but instead I pretended that those words had helped me, for his sake. That moment was nothing but a reminder of how wide the gap is between me and every other living person, how alone I really am.Alone. that is the root of all this. I could stomach all my uncertainty, my nihilism, my cynicism, the tangled, unnatural, unworkable psychological web I am trapped in, if there were a single living human being who could understand it. Could understand me. With whom I could share some common ground, even one idea or way of thinking. But there is not. I think I am probably insane. Some undiagnosed mental illness runs in my family, and drove my grandfather and great grandfather to paranoia, delusion, reclusively and violence later in their lives. Your response to my concern here will be to tell me to see a psychiatrist or therapist, since that suggestion is in vogue on this website right now. Well, I have seen them. Two different therapists. I even tried to be honest with them. And the response, the ideas and suggestions they gave me were so asinine, so off base, so completely missing the point that I almost could not believe it. I felt insulted. I doubt there is any help for me in the field of mental health, any more than there was for cancer patients in the days of Hippocrates.I do not know why the hell I wrote any of this. it is either a cry for help or an attempt to put something of myself into words for others to see before I cease to exist. \"non omnis moriar\".

My first year at work was not that good since I did not have much responsibilities, yet in my 2nd year I become more a valuable team member. The problem is that my social life become more miserable when my professional life is getting better. I am an introverted person, I have my small circle of friends. The issue began when I traveled abroad (Work related) and come back to the company after 3 months to find out that everyone has forgotten me, not only there but my hood friends also has forgotten me too. I had very close friends, but only a 3 months separation has ended my relationship with my best friends. I become the same old lonely person I used to be, when I thought that this has been changed after I met my new friends. But I was wrong, I am by myself now. I do not have any one to share my stories, my ambitions, my daily routine. I want that simple check in question to feel that I belong to this world, to be valuable to someone at least.Adding to that, I started to like my best friend, we were very close but after the 3 month separation, our relationship become very cold, it made it harder for me to confess to her. Being alone and failing in love with my crush which does not share the same feeling with me.Just wanted to relieve my chest of this grief. Any tips would be very helpful. Lost the will to hmm ...

I am medicated for anxiety/depression, have a partner I love and that is so supportive, a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll, especially since COVID- its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me, I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic provider/provide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous, anxious / patients in pain and I feel like a sponge- all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp, that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care, nothing is/has ever been worth the copay.

{"id": "14940", "text": "I keep jumping back and forth between wanting to die and wanting to keep going or keep trying. I do not know where to begin so I guess I will just spill my thoughts until I feel as though I have written enough. No one gets it. No one believes that I would actually do it, including me sometimes... I want to make the world better, I want to make the people in my life better... but I know that is just me trying to control others, which is something I know deep down is wrong. So, the alternative to acceptance of my circumstances, often seems nice. I took my mom in almost two years ago... both her parents died in 2014, and the fight over what little inheritance there was to fight over caused her to become estranged from her four sisters. She has not spoken to them since, and neither have I. All this happened a year after my 2013 sobriety date (I am a recovering heroin addict). I took her in because she had debted herself into a hole she could not crawl out of. I am 28 years old, 8 years sober and was 7 years deep into a career as a restaurant manager when covid hit. I did not get laid off right away, in fact I kept going at my job until It was demanded of me that I move to a location that was a 3 hour commute from my home. My company did not give me any other options, and so I told them no, and thankfully qualified for unemployment. I probably should have just sucked it up and done the drive every day but I was depressed, my car was barely making it to work as it is and I already hated restaurant management so I ended the relationship so to speak. My mom told me it would be 4 months until she got back on her feet and could afford to rent a room on her own, its now been almost two years. She, of course, used covid as an excuse to prolong her comfort. I wish people could understand how difficult it has been to deal with her, the shittiest version of her that has ever lived. She is awful. She cuts me down at every turn, manipulates me into considering that I am a bad son for even suggesting that she should leave my home. I wanted a family, kids, I was even lucky enough to find a girl who did not mind that my mother was living with me. Sam is great... but my mother has even come between her and I and started arguments that would have otherwise not happened. she is lazy, she is depressed and I find myself brought down to a degree of insanity that I never thought possible, especially while sober; and a similarly depressed state. Obviously, I am depressed. I want to have a purpose. I am smart, able-bodied, and ready as ever to affect change onto the world but I do not have a good outlet for it. Maybe I do... I have recorded a few different videos for youtube on various topics, they are all really good and I know that deep down, but I just cannot bring myself to post them. When I look back on my life, my childhood especially, I realize that critiques were easy to find, where praise was absent. And I know that, because of this, my self-esteem really holds me back from doing all the things I want to do, but even knowing that, I just cannot seem to surmount my fear of failure... or ridicule. I think I just need compliments or someone to tell me everything is going to be alright or someone to tell me to chase my dreams because I am beautiful or some stupid bullshit like that. I need someone to support me that is not me... I wish I had that. I am getting angry. I would never hurt anyone that was not myself, and that, at least, is something I can take pride in... that no matter how angry I got at the world, my default setting would because me to simply leave it, rather than attempt to destroy it. I wish I was not born into a world where a dad would rather take exotic trips every week than help out his son who is taking care of the woman he abandoned. I wish I was born into a world where good ideas and awesome people were celebrated and encouraged rather than torn down at every juncture possible. I wish I was born into a world where there were no examples of \"men who died before their time\". I wish the world were different. But it is not my world. So, as Ghandi instructed I will try my best to be the change I want to see in the world, and pray that it becomes better before I can gather the courage to leave it. If you are feeling hopeless like me, all I can say is... I hope one day I have the opportunity to appreciate you... I will not be offing myself today.

Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping ,I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say \"forgive me God\",I was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h ,to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50/100 prostrations and reading everyday ,fasted for half a year every year, I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick, and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday, not to make a single sin and do everything right.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and throws them.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father (who was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one) told me.All these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it game me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like \"it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed\" and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven ,I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head :how of you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair, and crows eating the belly of people who eat the guts and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?

Quite for a while, I may say. Last year's covid waves have left me alone in the dark bunker of my home with just enough support to allow food and the internet. This solitude has even changed me a bit - I have stopped drinking, started intermittent fasting and so on. Now I consider returning to alcohol.

Now the fire has gone out. A small amber of hope still glows though, and that is the reason why I only *consider* a final surrender.Another bad thing, I guess, is that I have come to a certain conclusions about our universe. They basically state that after death we do not experience anything. No time, no darkness, nothing. And after some time we will exist again in the future, because it is our only option to *exist*. As an addition to those conclusions I have got the idea that the life cycle will repeat in one way or another. Until something changes enough in one of the lifes, so we would be redeemed from our regular life cycles. The final surrender does not make it better though, as in my mind it may make things worse, but who cares on the end of the line? I have just been driving with my eyes closed.", "class": "Depression"}

My sympathy goes out to anyone struggling with loneliness right now. Why does healthy love have to be so difficult to find? Why does depression make it a hundred times more difficult? Why are there so many bottlenecks to meeting the right person? I know there is at least one person out there I would get along with super well, if not a hundred thousand people, so where are any of them? When one has to weed through a thousand bad matches to find one good one, does not it make justified sense why so many people entirely give up on love, especially those who struggle with depression?I am one of those people. I try to keep my chin up but my path ahead does not look bright. I have been struggling with suicidality and severe depression for two years, barely able to cope. I have had three jobs and all of them have soon after ended due to my mental health quickly deteriorating. I am embarrassingly about to start filing for disability for mental health reasons, and that only makes my chances of finding someone willing to be in a relationship with me even slimmer. Nearly everyone is looking for people who already have all their shit together, but what about those of us who do not? What about those of us who might never reach that point? do not we deserve love just as much as anyone else?All I want is someone to live life with. I am tired of living without living. I just want to live with somebody and spend my days loving them. I want someone who understands how depression can make someone like myself seem like a fully functioning member of society one day and someone who gave up on life the next. Someone who one day is extremely confident and invested in the music I write and the next day feels no motivation to continue with it. If I could control my depression, control my mood, and get my shit together- that would make my life a million times easier- but I (at least currently) cannot seem to do that, and as a result, I am all alone and struggling to meet anyone I would make a good pair with, and I bet I am not the only one.

{"id": "17706", "text": "When the topic is about loneliness and being alone people say \"attractiveness do not matter TOO MUCH\" but they are lying because they do not want to seen like an \"bad\" person.When you change context where they can say what they really think truth comes out. Here is an example i read today on r relationship advice.Post is about a young man getting more fit and his close female friend asking him out. She rejected him before because he was \"ugly\".Some of the comments when you do not look bad saying it in this context but it is true all the time:* \"I feel like physical attraction is a huge part of a relationship. does not really make sense to date someone you are not physically attracted to, but you are right that physicality is a fraction of what makes people right for each other.\"* \"Sexual attraction is a MUST.\"* \" People keep saying like oh its the confidence difference like dude I got more confident because people were telling me how good I looked when I put on muscle and trim up better. \"* \" it is mostly about looks. Get over it, dude. \"* \" Physical attraction is just important, and generally a prerequisite \"* \" News flash ... Many people who like their partner like them because of how they look. \"* \" Every girl has a filter for physically unattractive men. Luckily you had the only unattractive physical quality that can be easily changed weight. And now you are past her filter. Congratulations. \"These people comes places like this and tell us \"its about your personality.\" No it is not. Some of us ugly. that is it.But i believed these people before. I thought \"oh if i improve my personality i can find someone.\" Yeah you can improve your personality IF YOU HAVE BIG PROBLEMS. Like really bad habits or addictions that makes your life worse. Examples like that can be really make big changes. But other than that \"improving personality\" do not actually mean anything. it is an empty word. Everyone has different personalities. Having depression is not a personality. it is an health issue and it can be fixed. Depression stops you being you. it is an illness. Doctors literally gives you pills for this. There is no pills for personality.\"it is your personality\" is an insult. What do they mean it is our personality ?? They do not even knows us. All of us so different from each other. All of our hobbies and lifestyles are different. Our political view is different. Our views about life and what we want from it is different.These is why sometimes we see people saying \"even bad people have relationships but i do not have any.\" They think this and feel bad about themself. They believed the lie. If we look how many people started a relationship it will be LOOKS &gt; PERSONALITY. Always. This is why. it is this easy. What personalities change is how long the relationship will last and what will people experience in this relationship. that is it.Looks come first and THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. it is so much better when you know you are alone because you are ugly. Saying everyone \"it is personality\" is actually the bad thing. Like swear to me or literally punch me in the face. It hurts so much when everyone lie and say \"its personality\". it is like \"it is your finger print. This is why you are lonely :) \" Everyone has different finger print stoooop.I am saying these because i believed this 5 years ago when i was 19. I tried improving my \"personality\". I tried everything these people said to me. Nothing worked. And i find myself having a major depression. I used pills with doctor prescription for 3 years. I lost all my friends. Just now I am becoming healthy again and now i can find friends again too. I asked them about my apperance and most of said \"you are unattractive\" and I LOVE MY FRIENDS because of this. Thank Youu!If you do not have a relationship and want to have one here is what you ACTUALLY SHOULD DO:1. Improve your looks. Make yourself look attractive as much as possible.2. Fix your bad habits. Most of us has bad habits that we do not actually like doing it. Like watching too much tv or playing video games. These can be little lifestyle changes too. Like living in place where you do not like or working in a job you hate. These things are habits too, you do it every day. Try to change this things becasue they supress your personality and emotions.3. Try being more healthy. Mentally and phsycially.4. Dating is NOT a must. do not believe the media and people. You can be happy alone too and your friends. If you want someone try to do not make this your main goal and take it easy. \"Personality matters more.\" made me have major depression for 5 years.", "class": "Depression"}

And its rearing its ugly head again, or I am. (I am trying not to place the blame on the anxiety, I need to own it)I have been obsessively checking my partners location using Find My - even when I know where she is (work, home, sisters, etc) It occurred to me recently, What would I do if she was not where she said she was? It always worries me when she (or my past partners) would go out for the night to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. I get this overwhelming feeling that they are going to find someone better, bring them home and be unfaithful; just the thought of it makes my stomach turn. I want to be able to tell myself that is not likely and get out of my own head but Its all I can think about. It does not help that my current partner is Bipolar 2 and has manic episodes where her sex drive is elevated - that scares me even more. What if she needs to scratch that itch and I am not around? What if she is mad at me and does it to get back at me? What if this? What if that? Its a deep rabbit hole. To pile on the crap, she works retail and I have an office job so there is several hours every night that I try to keep myself busy and not imagine her sneaking off from work to be with someone else. Speaking of work, she is fairly new at this job in a management position and they are already talking about moving her to a new store possibly out of state as the next step career wise. Now this is not for a few years but I have got obligations here that make it more challenging for me to pack up and move to a new state if that is what happens. She, she just has me and lately its felt like she would be willing to drop me like a sack of potatoes should the offer come up.Its been a recurring argument; we never have time for just us you are always on about workJust be present with me they call you in every day, even on your days off its taxing to say the least. We talked recently and it came up that our priorities are out of order Hers are: 1. Her career 2. My Career 3. Our relationship Mine are: 1. Our relationship 2. Our careers It just feels like she is not willing to compromise at all. I have asked her multiple times if she would be willing to but its always I do not know what my plan is yet I do not want her to give up her future for me but I do not want to be considered when she thinks about her future, that does not seem crazy, right? The icing on the cake is I have developed a little bit of a weed addiction. Problem is - I work for Uncle Sam. And also, I act like such a child when I am high. I try not to I try to be chill like everyone else but when I am high is the only time I feel like I can not worry about everything else.So yeah I act like a child when I am high because the rest of the time I have to hold everything together and its this sweet sweet release from that. I do not know what the point of this rant is - is it a confession, is it a rant, I just want to be heard, validated maybe. What does it look like from the outside?Ask questions for clarification if you want. I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life", "class": "Depression"}

Right now I am living in an abusive household, which caused my low self esteem issues. I dumped all my problems on him and he tried to fix me, but all I did was complain he did not love me the right way (I needed words of affirmation to build up my self esteem, I now know that I do not need it from him but from myself. I am in therapy now). he does acts of service as his love language which I did not understand before. He actually tried to build me up before with words of affirmation but then stopped when all I did was complain. He loves me very much but he is so stressed with work and he has no free time for himself, that its stressing him out to focus on me and zero time for himself. He had episodes of depression before where pushed others away, but I stayed firm and did not leave him. He actually let me in and let me comfort him. He trusts me and is vulnerable with me a lot. Hes tried to push me away before and say that his depression will hurt me in the end but I said I accepted him the way he is. But my actions did not show this!!!!About a month ago he almost died from Covid. I was the only one there for him besides his other friend. He felt guilty that I did so much for him. I was angry and did not feel appreciated by him and told him so. He tried to compensate by giving me more of his free time and doing acts of service, but I was still bitter. he told me later that he really does appreciate me, he just has a hard time with words). A few days before breakup we were intimate and he said I love you. A few days later we got into a fight where I accused him of not appreciating me, so he broke up with me. Said someone else will love me right and not hurt me like the monster he is. He told me his life is out of control and he cannot date right now. Also, he said that we do not fit because I said he hurt me and that he does not love me like I want him to. also our schedules currently do not line up either. he says I do not understand his love language so we do not fit.He said he tried to love me but hes letting me go because he knows hell hurt me worse down the road. I am now in therapy working to heal. I have been no contact for a few weeks now. but i do not want to sever all connections. A week after no contact he messaged me saying he misses me and I was his best friend. Hes been periodically checking up to make sure I am doing ok. I have been telling him Ill change, Ill become confident but he says no you are perfect the way you are. He thinks he is responsible for a lot of my misery in the relationship when I would cry and pressure him for words of affirmation. (terrible behavior from me). OBVIOUSLY right now we both need time and space to heal. But I miss him, he was like my best friend. this is a good man and I hurt him with my issues and told him hes not loving me right. And he hurt me with his issues. I feel so horrible and I really want him back. But I know right now is not a good time for dating. After giving him some space, how do I reach out and be there for him?? And how long to wait? a month, two? should I completely go no contact or reach out from time to time to see how hes doing ? should I ask for forgiveness? he blamed himself for everything and says he is a monster.

{"id": "17297", "text": "I will preface by saying the last 15 years of my life have been sheer and utter hellfamily and other abuse in my teen years, constantly struggling through college on my own, abusive romantic relationship*s*, my own health issues, family members bad health choices sending them in and out of the ICU and the last few months I have struggled with the murder of one of my very best friends. I have just reached my breaking point, you know? The metaphorical straw is I have had a plumbing issue in my new house. This house has been nothing but problems since the day I got the keys. Our home warranty is expiring in a few weeks and I thought I might as well try a claim since I have handled every single other crisis on my own, I might as well try to get my moneys worth. If there is one thing you can take from this word vomit, do not bother with home warranties. Turns out its more headache than its worth. I filed a claim, and they charge a $100 service technician fee by deploying a contractor of their choice. The person they sent came unprepared and did not have the right tools to even try and diagnose the problem. The technician told me that its totally fine that sewer gas is leaking into our walls. I had to explain to him that no, I cannot just ignore a toxic and flammable gas pouring into my wall just because I do not use that drain very often. So he declared he does not touch ceilings (to look in the space where the pipe is when he did not bring the right tools to look in the drain) and left. And of course, my warranty claim was marked as completed right away. Deciding that its not worth pursuing fixing the problem with this company, I called and asked for a refund of the service technician fee because they failed to diagnose the problem or do, well, anything. And of course Tim with a thick accent and in a wind tunnel from oceans away is the only person I could talk to. They refuse to refund the money merely because a service tech walked through my door even though they did nothing. Apparently an unprepared technician with dangerous advice is worth $100. I have gone around and around with Tim and their online customer service and am met with nothing but canned scripted responses with I am sorry you are dissatisfied with your service per your contract Without using a human functioning brain to think well, huh, the contractor did not actually DO anything. You know, if I were to mess up at my job, we would not pass that on to the clientwed eat it ourselves. Such is the cost of doing business and making a mistake. Tim apparently is on an island all by himself because there is no one to transfer to.Its not even about the money itself$100 is not breaking the bank for me. Its the principle of the matter that every second of my life has to be hard. Every thing is a fight. Nothing can just WORK. I spend hours arguing on the phone with my health insurance because they have denied another claim yet again. Hunting down doctors and clinics that do not answer phones or send your message to die in a voicemail box no one checks. I spend hours on the phone arguing with the local utility company because despite having payment confirmation right in hand, they declare I have not paid and am getting water shut off in 30 minutes. Its the never ending research, calling, following up, arguing and everything with contractors to fix this damn house. The incessant advertisements, spam calls, marketing emails, update this! or sign up for that! That fills up my day. We all get 24 hours a day, 9 of mine are devoted to work, a handful of hours for sleep if I am lucky, and somewhere in there I am supposed to figure out how to have the mental stamina to eat, bathe, work out, and clean. The rest is spent constantly having to fight SOMETHING. there is no time to do anything good for myself. I cannot work on level 2 things in life if I am constantly fighting in level 1. I had goals, dreams and hopes. Aspirations and hobbies. It all feels so futile and pointless now. How can I study for the LSAT when all of my waking hours are filled with garbage like this? How can I allow myself to relax and have hopes for the future when any time I think maybe the latest storm is passing and I can breath, the latest new tragedy strikes. It happened again the day before I lost my best friend. I dared to have the audacity to think it was finally time to study and go to law school and then boomthe next morning I get the call that they are dead. It happens every time. So this $100its symbolic of how our (as the little people in this capitalistic hellscape that is the USA) entire existence is for exploiting. Marketing. Manipulating us to buy, buy, buy. No one is on our side. We can file complaints and charge backs but in the end, the corporation is all that matters. Nothing will happen to them, and we are all getting squashed. I have wanted to kill myself ever since I gained consciousness as a child. For 25 years, I have wanted to die. I always held out for the maybe when. Maybe life will be worth living when I move out of my abusive familys home. Or when I graduate college. Or when I get my adult job. Or when I can finally leave an abusive relationship. When I get married. Every time I have fought to remove something toxic in my life, another toxicity takes its place. I have reached the point where there is no more maybe when. I am maxed out in life. there is no more next steps for me. I have done all the things. I graduated high school and college, got a real adult job, I am married and bought a house. All of my friends are leaving me behind in the dust with their advanced degrees they got because they had family support and their kids they get to have because their families will watch them. I will have none of those things because I have to choose between paying student loans that never go down and health care that covers nothing versus going to school or having kids. The math does not add up. I do not know where to go from here. Every second of my life is a battle and I am tired of fighting. I am tired of being under the thumb of this terrible culture.

Thanks, Tim. I hope they at least pay you well to justify engaging in such a horrible business model. I do not remember the last good day I had.

{"id": "17911", "text": "Hey guys this is my first ever Reddit post. I am struggling. I have already had panic disorder, major depression and anxiety but this year has been really bad. I am 20 years old and my dad lost his job due to his alcoholism in October. I was not prepared for this and had no savings, my mom gave me some money that she had tucked away to help me move out, I moved out and my roommates were horrible to me and I was miserable, I ended up in a mental health facility with suicidal tendencies. After I got out I decided it was a good idea to move back in with my mom but out of a manic paranoid decision I quit my job. My mom assured me that if I took a month off it would be okay because my dad had some unemployment left, well turns out he does not, and the lease here ends in two months and I have $0 saved up to go any where and neither does my mom. We are on the verge of being homeless. I start a new job on Thursday but doubt I will make enough in two months to pay my bills AND move out. I am desperate for a place to live soyesterday I swallowed my pride and asked my sister if I could stay with her and her boyfriend for a few months because they have an extra bed room that they do not use and I thought I was really close with her. She straight up told me no and it crushed me. I love her so much and we have always been so close ands he knows the situation I am in. I know it is not her job to take care of me but Jesus Christ I am dying here. I do not know what else to do and I am scared the relationship with my sister is cracked now. My friend offered me a place to atay at her parents which is so generous of them but what about my mom ? Where is she and my dog to go. I could move into a place with her and help her pay the rent but I am so sick of my parents fincancial problems being my problems. Ever since we were little money has always been the topic of conversation . I feel like I was robbed of my childhood and young adult hood. I know it sounds like I am throwing myself a pity party but I did not get the same opportunity my siblings did, they got to stay with my parents until they were ready to leave, I am being forced into the world without a clue of what I am fucking doing. Anyways, I have no idea how to be alive I feel like i do everything wrong, and I make inpulsive decisions and I feel like a fucking failure at barley 20 years old. This has really taken a hit to me and my mental illnesses and I am struggling with suicidal thought agin. If anyone has any advice for me I would gladly take it . Thank you for listening if you made it this far. Hi I need help", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "7770", "text": "Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "13229", "text": "If I believed in some type of a joyful eternal afterlife, I might be able to guess that any resilience evidenced within this earthly lifetime would ultimately be rewarded to a way more intense degree than any I could imagine inside my simple, small intellect. I just impulsively checked for some relevant data online and found out that there might be something like over 2 billion Christians on earth.But as it remains, I believe that possibly nothing special happens to us after we die. Following death, there is just immediate darkness, silence, numbness -- nothing. The experience of death is akin to the experience of deep dreamless sleep.I can vividly remember how incredibly purposeful my life felt during childhood, when I was thoroughly religious and believed that everything I was doing was being gleefully monitored by a loving God (or maybe multiple gods) who wanted the best for me and other humans. But as the years passed and I encountered more and more unanswered / blatantly ignored prayers, I grew to express some minimal amount of basic skepticism toward the idea that any deity loves us or actively participates in our lives.While I will not get specific about my problems within this post, I will just mention in passing that I have almost certainly suffered much more than at least 80% of my generation's peers. And as my suffering has gotten worse across time, I have come to reach a point at which I have found no higher purpose to my suffering -- there is no probable reward one faces for continuing to deal with severe, crippling, life-ruining depression.Laughable as this may seem, I used to believe that continued suffering would result in the cultivation of continued wisdom, almost as if the reward for ongoing pain was to become a goldmine of hard-won insights which could (one day) easily wrest a fresh interlocutor out of fairly deep suffering via pithily expressed wisdom. But now all I deal with each day is a sort of ... numb resignation before a potentially premature end to life.What am I supposed to do if I can realistically expect sporadically increasing suffering in my near and continued future? In the absence of religious belief, there seems to be no way to derive any sense of meaning or fulfillment from a life of serious and potentially mind-destroying suffering.Life feels like it is losing its meaning with each passing day. Does my suffering have no higher purpose?", "class": "Suicidal"}

My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation.

Thr way I was brought up and my childhood experiences paved way to why I am like this in adulthood. I am grieving. My parents does not grasp that their adult child is mentally unwell. Of course, it is my fault. I get all the blame. It hurts when your own mother would label you some deregatory term in our language -- \"dugyot\" means a lazy dirty person. It hurts that they do not understand my struggles. I am trying. I grieve that I will never have the parents that I \"needed\". I was crying silently last night. I was a victim of domestic abuse and they offered me to come move back. I know I need therapy but I do not have the means to pay yet.

On and off numerous medications throughout the years, nothing worked because, at the end of the day, I did not have things in life that brought me joy as others did. I was an awkward introvert with anxiety and depression. I fought through depression for years and really busted my but to get a good job and work up and create goals for myself to really not let depression get me. I have a great job. I am so grateful for what I have and yet.... Life. Just. Feels. Pointless. I feel like i am drifting with no direction and I cannot seem to pull myself out of this pit. Everything this I do just does not make this feeling go away. Therapy and acknowledging why I have attachment issues and things from my past doest change the feelings. I understand my past, I understand my issues, but knowing this or talking about it does not change my obsessive thoughts and deep depression. Medications never stopped my thoughts, sleeping pills barely helped my sleep. On top of my already struggling chemical depression, I feel my life has just gone down the drain of everything I worked for. Ill skip the childhood and long list of life trauma and jump to the past year topresent. Since I worked hard to overcome those....My fiance and I broke up because I walked away from a toxic situation to try to better my life. He was bipolar. Anxiety medication made me gain 40lbs (I was underweight before so this was not making me obese but it still did not feel good and cannot' seem to shake it)I have lost 6 family members in the past 3 years including my sister. My fiance told me not to bother him with my grieving because it was annoying. So i learned to just deal on my own. When I was trying to move on from my ex, my male friend tried to rape me at a party. When I tried to talk to anyone about it everyone just told me to get over it so i did and kept on moving forward. I moved my job and gave up the home I owned to be with my ex, who changed his mind. Learned to appreciate it and enjoyed the ride. I am living in a temporary apartment trying to decide where to live with no furniture bc why bother if i do not stay. Lived trying to appreciate how nice it is in a new place. I had a pay cut at work due to the pandemic forcing me to live in a cheaper place far away and now have to travel 1.5 hours to the office each way. But that is okay, more time for audio books. I did not let any of those things get me down. I tried to just find happiness in everyday things and get through. I knew walking away from a bad relationship would be hard, but that it would lead me to a better life. Things started to look up, I got a raise, I started working out daily, was really putting in the effort to say yes to things instead of no, spent a lot of time outdoors, read as many books as I could. Joined a few dating sites to keep my options open to love. A year after my break up and moving out we had a long weekend at work for the 4th. I got depressed, no friends were around, i felt so lonely and pathetic. Went running, to the pool, I got myself some nice craft beers and just started reading, watching funny movies and just tried to pull myself out of this. Even treated myself to sushi to try to cheer me up and just enjoy my time with myself. But by the final day of a long weekend alone, after many many months alone. I just broke down and cried. Ended up drinking a bit and just let it out. Felt my depression. BUT then. Random burst inside of my overwhelmed me and i said to myself...I will NOT give up. I am awesome and great and I know someone will see that. I am fun to be with, loveable, funny, I have a great career, finances growing, i got this, made a visionboard. So after 1 year of dating sites, I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of guys. I feel like I can tell pretty quickly when I click or do not, and really have not experienced any conversation of interest. I still knew id find someone but was picky for a conncetion. People told me it was because i was not open or wanted my ex, but I really was open, I just could not find the chemistry I was looking for in a partner. I really try to add to the convo and ask questions and elaborate to build connections, I am really good one on one building connections. But then... an incoming message from someone new. just another guy that took the time to write something out but the responses had so much personality to them. I started getting excited to see them come in. We moved to another chat app and starting messaging from sun up to sun down every day for a few days, then he asked me out. He was busy but wanted to make it for the following weekend. We continued to chat all day every day completely connecting on so many levels. He really confirmed he was interested in me and was so excited to meet me and was clear i was what he was looking for and everything we chatted about was deep and connected and understanding and always followed up that we were still interested. Nothing really changed and then in the second week of chatting, pics, and videos. We were writing back and forth, he usually initiated and we both continued the convo. nothing happened or was said but it one second after i respond I was left with \"unread\". Never heard from him again and it is been about a week and he never even opened the message. I sent another one a few days ago just expressing I wish him the best and enjoyed chatting and such but thought we connected and were still interested. That was never opened as well. I had not been blocked thought, maybe that was something as my mind obsessively overthinks it. Anyways, skip to a week later. I got too attached to someone I never met. I was walking on air excited to chat with someone I was so into. We talked too much it honestly felt implied we would clearly be dating after meeting and that was just a formality. I get it, I was stupid to care before the meeting. But I could not help it. I was still chatting with others to not put eggs in a basket but no one had my attention as he did. It felt easy and effortless. I took a break from online dating to recoup and ground myself. Obsessive thoughts consumed me. What happened? what did I do? He was so reassuring and thoughtful. I could not sleep for a week. I could not control my thoughts of failure after a year of trying after my fiance and i broke up. I stared at my computer all week watching emails and emails come in with no desire to respond. Depression has taken over. I decided to take to reddit just to let my feelings out. I am finding work so pointless. Making money for what? To be alone? I had a few friends, they were depressed too getting out of bad situations as well and trying to find love. All of a sudden LAST NIGHT. I HIT THE WORST LOW continuing into today. My friends have all left, two found new fresh love and are on the moon with joy after barely anytime being single (inspired by how happy they saw me talking to that guy) and they took to themselves and found people quickly and enjoying their start and really do not want to deal with depressed me. I was the one being so optimistic to them, telling them they got this and really trying to radiate positive energy. I am happy for them I wanted to see this as the universe showing love around me as if it was close for me too....but the universe slammed me with the same day, another death. Another male friend cut me out because I told him that i did not see a romantic future with him and he kept trying to manipulate me to want the same things. It got ugly. My ex reached out saying he wished he could have loved me but just does not and does not know why he cannot care about me but wished he could. I got so low, made a call to everyone on my phone list that I talk to, and no one was around. I went for run. Talked to a shrink who told me just to meetup with someone and get out. (that is always the advice) No one was around. Walked for 4 hours straight. Called a psychic just to give me some hope, something. Just ended up making me feel worse. I am now sitting on my computer writing on reddit drinking whiskey out of the bottle realizing that I am defeated. I think my depression has won. I tried to overcome all these situations, better myself. \\*\\*\\*Now I am realizing i feel more depressed a year out of my toxic relationship than I ever felt in it. Wishing i had it back because this feels worse. I cannot get myself to work. I am distracted in my mind all day every day. I cannot make myself leave my bed. I feel left behind. Like everyone is moving along and no matter how hard I try. I keep getting kicked. I stare at the ceiling for hours on end. Everything I tried to do to stay positive came collapsing. Donated some money to some charities. Tried to volunteer but I get anxious in groups. Bought some nice things incase I got a date, to make me feel good. Did a juice cleanse to boost my health. Increased my exercise. I was going to my apartment pool, gym, anything to get myself out and about. At this point now. I cannot even get myself to watch tv or a movie, cannot read a book, cannot work. Every time I get a mere boost of energy to be positive I get more news that brings me down. Staring at a phone checking for that message that never comes. The psychic told me to change my energy. I feel like everything I do has failed and I am in such a dark place right now. I see loneliness or the company of people I force myself to be around since I am an introvert and do not connect with just anyone. I cleaned, I decluttered, i did all these positive things. Even feng shui and crystals around the place to create good energy. I thought I had the light at the end of the tunnel after that long weekend, but now, i am at such a low i really cannot get myself out of it. I do not even have those small moments of pulling it together to clean or shower like I did before. I will probably get in trouble at work but I wish I could care but just do not. Happiness should not depend on other people, i know this. But what do you do when nothing brings you joy. I was happy alone for a while, i liked myself, i saw myself as a catch and worthy of love. But now, I just feel kicked and defeated as nothing will ever change and all the men I like do not want me. The men I do not see a connection with romantically try to hurt me. or manipulate me. If life is settling, what is the point. If all there is work and exercise. I just do not see the joy in life. I give up. I am really really sad right now. I feel my life is pointless. Like is life really just holding on every day? There has to be more than just holding on. I was able to work through a lot of things but now I do not feel it. I do not feel like life gets better. I just feel defeated and at the lowest darkness I have ever felt. I overcame things for what? I feel so dark and low. Thanks to whoever is reading this and letting me vent this, long annoying rambling. I have hit my lowest low in life as of today...I just give up", "class": "Depression"}

{"id": "13188", "text": "I am frustrated. that is the constant theme with my life. I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity. My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted \"some job I could tolerate\" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against \"the enemy\" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives. In a sense I am back where I was before. Just waiting to die. Wanting to \"just get by\" long enough to finally be rid of it. I hate this.

Since 11 or 12, I have experienced depressive episodes and severe depressive symptoms. it is only gotten worse as I have gotten older, taken on more responsibility, been burned more and more by people, repress my heart/desires to live a more fulfilling life and travel and take risks, etc. I have done more or less all of the conventional things like therapy, tried multiple drugs, I even was in a year-long clinical trial for an experimental drug for treatment-resistant depression, etc. For a while, I was able to travel for 4-6 weeks during the winters, and I did that for three winters in a row and it was probably the happiest I have been in years. But despite all of the good things happening in my life lately, I tend to always dwell on the really negative things, all of the trauma I have experienced, all of the devalue and discard, the manipulation and cruelty of others, the sense of worthlessness and the morose sense that nothing really matters and that we will all be forgotten one day. For the last 2-3 years, I have been really, really struggling to finally find something that works. Suicidal ideation is more or less always there, but just at different intensities and volumes depending on what is happening and how I am feeling. I have a lot to live for right now and want to be here to be a part of my daughter's life, but I have not had much if any success with mood drugs, talking to my primary care doctor, seeing a psychologist, etc. I feel like I almost have to do something dramatic like check myself in somewhere in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan and finally be taken seriously. I have always been afraid of the costs and possible intervention from police/authorities, but at this point, I have lived like this for so long, I cannot imagine living another 15-20 years like this.

When I saw the weight start to come off, I just kept it going. Very unhealthy way to do it, but I felt satisfied with myself for the first time ever. But over the last 3 years the weight has gradually started to come back with various influencing factors. Every time I have started the process to attempt to get healthy in a safe way, inevitably a new depressive episode hits and my ability to do simple tasks tanks and I am left in survival mode and not caring about what or how much I put into my body. I fear going home. I fear going back to school this semester for the simple reason that my primary instructor felt the need to point out my weight a few weeks ago. Now, I have not gained all of it back, but definitely a significant portion. And yet, why is that her business? Why should she point it out as if it had any bearing on my scholastic ability?Anyways, I guess I just wanted to get this out. I am finally in a decent place mentally after tanking in January. I have caught up on very old dishes, did my laundry, and generally cleaned, and decluttered my apartment. I have been grocery shopping and meal prepping for the past week and making commitments to physical activity by investing in equipment for my home and taking Karate lessons.I feel like I can do it, but I am impatient and the anxiety of the realistic timeline for results against the timeline for the return to university has me second guessing every moment. But every moment I keep choosing to take care of myself even if it does not show to anyone else. yet. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Only thinking about how things might be better in the future, but not thinking about me in the present moment. I am good at putting on a smile and feeling fine for a moment (and sometimes I can feel good when being more active), but somehow I think I not only tricked others but sometimes also myself. But honestly: are you really okay when you are spending hours and hours doing nothing a day? Not doing anything? And just hating yourself both outside and inside? Just somewhat existing but that is it. I have only had two therapy sessions so far to cope with my negative self-image (and compulsive tendencies), and it is like finally it clicked with me HOW unhappy and lost I am. No you are not \"fine\" just because you are not suicidal. it is hard but I think I am getting to a point where I am realising that I am fucking insecure and that my life is empty. Maybe realising this will be a turning point.Every summer I feel incredibly lonely. While everyone is off having fun, I basically let two months pass by like it is nothing. I work, but other time is spent scrolling on the internet. Jealousy of others having fun comes over me, but I know ultimately it is down to me never asking my friends to do something, I think because I am afraid they really do not want to spend time with me in the end. I can be social and outgoing when I am in class, but once I come home I feel empty and I spend the rest of my day on my own in my own head. Lately I have really come to terms with the fact that yes, I fucking struggle mentally. it is like every summer I realise that yes, I do feel fucking lonely. I have friendships but they are superficial and I never really know how to voice my insecurities and thoughts with them. I miss meaningful friendships in my real life. I have lost friendships and it is totally due to my own lack of assertiveness. it is not that I did something wrong, but I just did \"nothing\". I do really hate myself for certain decisions I have made and not putting more effort in my life, but I also do not know where to start.it is like finally I am realising for myself that I am lost, I do not have it all together and I do not have to pretend I do because I cannot keep fooling myself. I am disappointed with myself and I am not really coping with how unsatisfied I am with my life. And it frustrates me to no end that I see people being busy and happy but that I feel constantly as I am missing that one thing that can make me like these people.

Successful sales career making six figures since 21, averaged a new car every 9 months and currently own 5. On my second home owned which is valued at $500k. Working on opening my first business now. [I wanted to include this because I feel people that know me on the outside assume I would be extremely happy with my life and my successes, but if anything it is caused me more pain and loneliness and THINGS are not the answer to anyone's depression. Also do not assume the people that appear to be in good places, really are in their mind, we just bandaid our problems with stuff to hide our problems from ourselves]I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, as early as 3rd grade I can remember pitifully trying to strangle myself with a balloon string (sounds silly how unrealistic that was looking back). I have tried ecstacy a handful of times but never in conjunction with peaks of depression and anxiety. After almost 8 years in the car business which definitely worsened my depression/anxiety significantly, i left to explore myself and start my own business which really took a toll on myself. This worsened since I took myself off of buproprion and sertraline 5 months ago after losing my insurance. Recently my girlfriend and I decided to do some ecstacy with just us at home, it was extremely therapeutic in regard to my mental health. There are 100% health downsides I am sure to this, but for my extremely infrequent use I am not worried about the downsides. here is how it helped me.To describe my mental health state prior to, I felt very empty and constantly in fight or flight. I have very little enjoyment in anything and found myself breaking down and crying more often to a breaking point. Why was I breaking down and crying? Because I felt so guilty thinking how badly I wish I could just disappear and how unfair it was to tell my sister who just had her first child that I did not want to be there to watch him grow. Or to tell my girlfriend that i do not want to start our life and family together because I would rather be gone. To clarify, i do not want to hurt or kill myself. But i cried even harder because I also was so destroyed realizing that the only answer is to stay and feel so empty and useless for the sake of everyone else which meant a life of pain for me. There was no winning.When we did ecstacy it allowed me to feel again (assuming a Seratonin pump) and it allowed me to appreciate. I was able to hold my girlfriend and just feel joy, feel how much she meant to me and how much i enjoyed her presence. It allowed me to remember what made life worth living, what happiness was like. I was able to work through all those thoughts inside with a fresh palate and an open mind. I was able to address things with myself that i was afraid to address. Think ways that I have not been able to for a long time. I had a shit eating grin the entire time and just felt so alive again. The next day was even better because it was a much lesser baseline but just enough to get through the day with the ability to feel good. Eventually the euphoria went away but my mind was at ease. Just because the \"high\" stopped, i was still able to work through my thoughts with myself and affirm my reasoning for being around. Unlike other drugs, you will likely remember your experience from ecstacy and similar drugs so that you can take away your thoughts with you. All in all, if you are in a very stuck place and unable to crawl out, i honestly feel a controlled experience like this may be good to let you revisit your life from a new perspective again and reason your way out of your hole. I am curious to hear people's opinions on this, either for or against. Happy to answer questions as well. Anyone use Ecstacy while depressed? My experience.", "class": "Depression"}

I am in for a shift at 4:00 today but I am already dreading coming in. it is at a fast food place and I am working at the till, becsuse they have not taught me anything else. I hide in the corner where the icream machine is to look busy, pretending not to see people queuing up because I am scared ill mess it up becsuse I do not know the register yet, and I do not want to be saying \"huh/what/sorry\" all the time because of the noise and masks.it is a small place, so with the masks and the noise from the kitchen, its really hard to hear people.I am terrified of phones. I get nervous when the phone rings when I am left alone at the front. I do not know, I hate it, but when I try to explain or think about it, I cannot find anything to say. Maybe because its not as bad as I think, but with my fear of people, and wanting to double check what everyone tells me, etc. because I am paranoid I will mess up or forget something, but as the same time I do not want to ask people because I do not want to be seen as clingy or strange.I think I picked the worst job for me but in the village I live in, there is not much else, and my parents were always going at me to get a job. I am just glad I put myself down for part time, because I do not want to be in there, but at the same time, if I was in full time, I would have figured out everything faster (i still do not now)I just do not know what to do. I want to quit, but it seems pathetic for me fo just quit after 3 days, and I have nothing else lined up .. it is only my 3rd day of having a job and I already cannot take it", "class": "Depression"}

At the same time, almost everything about it brings me deep dissatisfaction. My family is dysfunctional to the peak and I oftentimes feel mistreated by them.

My hair is embarrassingly important to me and it rarely ever looks good anymore, I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I am socially awkward and have no friends in school or even on the internet. I suck at school and despite my efforts have little future prospects. I am from a country with mandatory military service and I know that I am exactly the kind of wussy, quiet guy who gets tormented there. My biggest ambition in life is to leave my country, hopefully for America or Canada, but with the harsh immigration laws and my lack of a STEM inclination it will be near impossible. I seriously do not know what to do with my life. I am too much of a pussy to end it, not because I am scared of death but because I have the pain threshold of a piece of paper (despite having chronic illness for most of my life lol).

I think I feel things very intensely even if its a small feeling of love, anger, hat etc. My problem is I have started losing interest in things. Some days back I was really excited to make music which I did but lost interest in 2 days. Then I was interested in making a product that is environmental friendly and lost interest in a few days. I just lose interest in everything. I need suggestions on how I can be more patient and figure out things for myself. I do not want to be that human who would go for a shit ass job and work there 9-5.

I remember how full of life she was. She was a ray of light and sunshine, and I am reminded how dark and empty her eyes now are. Her sleepless nights are leaving their trail under her eyes. The loss of appetite has diminished her wardrobe, all the clothes she used to love to wear- now fall off her body. I am reminded she is empty and the walls are caving in.

I just feel so alone, like I am trapped in hell. I am 23 almost 24, been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 11. Had a traumatic childhood.. and now I just live with this eternal emptiness inside of me. Like no matter how good life can be at times, its never enough to eradicate this personal sadness and hopelessness that seems to plague me from time to time. I think about death, dying, and mortality all the time. The strange thing is I do not want to die, I just do not want to deal with life. Does that make sense? It feels like there is no point to me being here. I want to die before having to face the days my siblings or parents or friends die, I want to end this cycle of hopelessness that sits with me for years. Can someone tell me what is the fucking point of life? Work a job and scrap together money for survival? Spend most of my time alone in my head? Death is inevitable for everyone, I just want to control and know when its my time. Depression and anxiety wear me down constantly, I just wish I could feel actually happy and understand the point to repeating these days over and over again. Does anyone else feel like this?

They have hydrocephalus and multiple surgeries have left her with deficits both mentally and physically. She is probably cognitively equivalent to a 15 year old and has a great sense of humor and personality.Lately she has been gaining quite a bit of weight (54 and 300ish lbs) which has, in concert with her physical disabilities, made it very difficult for her to get around and she now has an even more significant risk of falling.Her mother does not purposefully enable her and is an excellent care taker but putting her on a diet is next to impossible because she is very picky and has been known to self harm if she does not get her way. Its safe to assume she has around six sodas a day. Switching to diet is not an option in her mind and The only alternative for drinks is juice and for sugar Gatorade. I am concerned she will become diabetic if she is not already. Another serious concern is that her mother will no longer be able to provide care for her if she cannot move her. Her mother is in her 60s and has her own health issues. She very regularly strained her back trying to help her daughter off the ground or couch. Even navigating the world with her daughter in a wheelchair is physically difficult for her mother.Does anyone have any tips, success stories, advice on how to approach this? I love her tremendously and I am concerned about her quality of life if we do not change the path we are on. we have considered the fact that if things do not turn around we may have to find an institution for her but she has so many medical problems that it would be difficult to arrange and it would be a total betrayal of trust.
