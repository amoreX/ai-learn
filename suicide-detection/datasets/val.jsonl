We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we \"dated\" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like \"I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend\" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend\". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say \"you deserve a nice boyfriend\" and things like that.

Never knew why I wanted to end my life, but I figured two weeks ago that I've never had a \"life\".  \nNew friends stopped coming by when I turned 10. Different schools, different personalities, never synching again. I started to grow up, and suddenly there were parties, gatherings, trending topics...   \nNone of which I had permission to enjoy, either from my parents or from myself. More time pass by and suddenly I find myself at the end of my high school life, graduation was coming closer and it was time to pick a major. \n\nBut who am I? I've not lived. The only world I know is the fantasies I created when alone in my room. The only voices I recognize are the ones I made when talking within my head. The only people I've met are ideas I made up when I saw someone else's face. \n\nI was in a protective bubble. Never experienced anything, so I had to do it myself. Never met anyone, so I had to make them up. It is like I've been born 3 years ago when I turned 18 and my parents decided I did not need protection anymore. \"Go on, live your life and do whatever you want!\" they said. \n\nI do not know what I want. I do not know where I want to go. I do not see a future or a past. I do not have the concept of \"dreams\" and \"goals\". I've just been born. Who am I? \n\nSomehow, this man-baby who is writing this found himself a girlfriend. The fantastical worlds I've made brought her attention to me. I like her. I love her. But who she likes is nothing but a pretender who doesn't know what is to live. And it's starting to show. \n\nI've made up my mind. I will find a job and save as much money as I possibly can.  Enough that SHE will live her dreams. Although heartbreaking for her, it's what I want. Now I have a wish. Now I have a goal.

{"id": "2685", "text": "A very tough lifeName's Michael, a youngling, 18, living in Costa Rica, University of Costa Rica Law School first year student. My father died recently. My father was my guide, my best friend, my mischievous buddy, we did everything together. He died of liver cancer on the hours between 11pm of Feb 12 and 1am Feb 13, I was woken up by my worried girlfriend (we were  in a call and was woken up by the same thing) and my mother screaming and pleading for mercy\nI didn't have a chance to see my father when he was hospitalized up until the day of his death, mere hours before it happened. He was drugged, only way through stop his unrelenting rebellious spirit that prevented him from staying in bed. Only thing I could get to say was that I had finally entered into law school, his dream come true, he was so happy. He wanted to kiss me, but he couldn't, he was too high. I kissed him instead, and begged him to stay still. I promised him I'd tell him more once he was out of the hospital. He replied to me with a particular set of words in Spanish he would always say to me \"ok, Mijo\" high and not willing to let me go but still letting me go because he understood I was uncomfortable. How I wish I hadn't.\nHow I wish he was still alive, still with me, still smiling and talking to me about his job in the private air charter flights company he administrated\nLife without him is so hard, it's almost not worth living\n\nAlmost.\nI still cling onto my now ex girlfriend. She has BPD, and I myself am not at my 100% sanity levels. She still loves me, so she claims. But during two months past my father's death, I treated her badly. I would be cold and edgy, saying things like nothing mattered in the end not even her, seeking help from anyone and anything that'd be willing to help me feel better, this worsened our situation, and long story short, we broke up. After nearly a year of full commitment, and 7 months of nothing but what we both wanted, a relationship 100% us and no one else, we broke up. I hurt her to the point where her entire body and life tells her not to come back to me. She keeps saying she wants to be better and healthier before we date again, as she also has cancer. A little detail I didn't mention before, that holds some importance. I always tried my best to take care of her as much as I could, even in her darkest times. It seems as though it's an excuse to gwork on herself and become independent and forget about me though. I'm soon to be diagnosed with ADHD as my therapist said I met all criteria but prefered I went to a psychiatrist for a Dx. So maybe that plays a part in the way I see things, and I sure hope it is\nBut then again\nSometimes she'll come to me and give me all that love, and sometimes it just seems as though she's tired of even talking to me. \nMy mother and other family members know me as the smart yet extremely quite kid. Not to make a joke and a stereotype about autism but, you know the kind. They expect so much from me, but I'm failing class, I'm failing my father, I failed to take care of him. My actions got him killed. I could've saved him.\nMy actions also ended a relationship both parties had invested tons into, and now I cling onto the idea that we will one day be back together, even though sometimes it seems like a straight off lie. But I've lost so much already, I've destroyed my entire life.\nIf she confirms my doubts and leaves, nothing will stop me from wanting to od, no matter how many things are pointed out, people that love me, things like that. Nothing works, I simply want out, and I don't know why I can't just feel okay again, this year has taken everything from me; even my will to live.", "class": "suicide"}

I\u2019m just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I\u2019m also self destructive. \n\nI moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it\u2019d make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. \n\nSo my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. \n\nThe job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. \n\nEventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. \n\nIt just wasn\u2019t enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. \n\nI left when I decided I should go to school. I\u2019m in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. \n\nMy first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don\u2019t even know if I want to do it anymore.\n\nI\u2019m just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I\u2019m back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don\u2019t think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. \n\nAt my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It\u2019s a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. \n\nI\u2019m visiting my friends in another state right now. \nReconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I\u2019m staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn\u2019t good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I\u2019ve really fucked it up now. She didn\u2019t even want to talk to me the next day after.\n\nWe are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won\u2019t go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. \n\nI just can\u2019t get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. \n\nI\u2019m a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. I\u2019m just out here dying and I\u2019m getting closer everyday to just saying \u201cfuck it\u201d. I just don\u2019t know how much more I can take. I\u2019ve been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didn\u2019t know what I was when I was that young. \n\nI don\u2019t know how far into 2018 I\u2019m going to make it. 2018 might be the last year of my existence. ", "class": "suicide"}

And why and how it is **SO VERY CRITICAL** right now that we bring LOVE / LIGHT to this election process; so that the history of humanity may be *REwritten* forever, as we ALL make our way right back into the LIGHT here no less. **(REMEMBER:** They can *censor your VOICE* or *erase your VOTE,* but **they can** ***NEVER EVER DO A DAMN THING*** **about your** ***INNER POWER*** to create the REALITY OF YOUR DEEPEST DESIRES. Know this. *Always.*  \n\n---  \n\n**AN IMPORTANT PRE-MEDITATION NOTE:** If you\u2019re new to mass meditation / manifestation, here\u2019s how it all even *works.* All you even need to do in here is to simply IMAGINE / VISUALIZE a situation / event / scenario / happening / occurrence *AS BEST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN,* and then, truly, deeply, ***FEEL*** all emotional feelings (and even physical sensations) associated with your experiencing *THAT VERY SCENE / SITUATION* --- all as if the said scene in question was unfolding in front of your eyes right at **THIS VERY MOMENT** (this is *key).* That\u2019s pretty much *it.* And that you keep doing *(\"tuning in\")* this as often as you can throughout your day, whenever you so get the free time to do so, for **MAXIMUM EFFECT AND** ***IMPACT!***  \n\nFinally, for those of who absolutely SUCK AT visualizing / imagination, **worry** ***NOT.*** Because, *at the end of the day,* it is only and **ONLY your INTENTION + TRULY FEELING** (as if what you\u2019d desired was literally happening *RIGHT NOW* in front of you) that gets the job done in here. And finally, if you suck at even THAT, worry not STILL! For you can always and ALWAYS make a very simple PRAYER to Yourself / Your Higher Self / God / Angels / Galactics / Ascended Masters etc. and get that job in question done REGARDLESS! Or just send that situation in question a BLESSING for the **HIGHEST OUTCOME POSSIBLE** (note: You can do this as many times as you possibly like) to get your chosen desire to come true *regardless!* Options aplenty to go around here with regards to achieving our end objective here, folks.  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP ONE:** Find the most COMFORTABLE space that you can possibly manage to find for yourself before beginning this meditation. Note that while this isn\u2019t necessarily a prerequisite, it is greatly ***ADVISABLE*** nevertheless for the best effect, here.  \n\nAlso note that you can freely do this meditation in any pose of your preference; sitting, standing, sleeping, whatever it is that you\u2019re the MOST comfortable in. (Because the more comfy you are here, the *better* and *more so powerful* shall be your meditation!). Also advisable to *\u201cset up\u201d* (beforehand) the place of your choice prior to your meditation (if this is at all possible), by setting up *multiple additional mind-calming agents* around yourselves such as calming music, incenses, crystals, candles etc. The clearer, calmer and more relaxed your mind, the more *POWERFUL* is your meditation!  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP TWO:** ASK all higher beings and energies (such as angels, God, ascended masters, higher selves, galactics, *passed-over* family and friends etc.) to **ASSIST and PROTECT you INFINITELY** during this meditation; as also **to amplify YOUR intentions / energies for you INFINITELY.** Kindly note here that THESE higher beings / energies are simply **NOT PERMITTED** to do so without your *EXPRESS FREE-WILL REQUEST/APPROVAL.* So **PLEASE** give them that permission/request so that *YOUR JOB* gets done a whole lot more easily in that way. And that even if/when you are unable to manage a given meditation instruction on here properly; that THEY can then step in on YOUR BEHALF and do it **FOR YOU** instead. It's a complete and total *win-win* for all of you folks.  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP THREE:** EXPLICITLY ASK God / Angels / Your Higher Self to LOCK your ENERGIES by making sure that they are used and utilized only and ONLY for the HIGHEST GOOD of the whole world at large and NOTHING ELSE. This *\u2018intention lock\u2019* basically prevents anyone else from misusing / stealing YOUR free energies for THEIR (guaranteed nefarious) intentions and purposes.  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP FOUR:** (if required, please visit the *\u2018Important Pre-meditation Note\u2019* provided above to re-learn the method/s necessary for doing this): **INTEND / VISUALIZE that the US election process goes smoothly, peacefully and in** ***COMPLETE INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY*** **in every single way and / or manner IMAGINABLE.**  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP FIVE:** INTEND / VISUALIZE that the RESULTS of this election are received PEACEFULLY and LOVINGLY; and **that the election in question puts into governance BEINGS OF THE HIGHEST LIGHT, BENEVOLENCE, SERVICE-ORIENTEDNESS, COMPASSION, KINDNESS, TRUTHFULNESS, INTEGRITY, HONESTY, PEACEFULNESS, WISDOM and above all, true UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.** It is suggested here that instead of visualizing actual people or candidates of your liking (not that you shouldn\u2019t be doing this), that you INSTEAD visualize BEINGS MADE OF LIGHT or ANGELS or SAINTS or ASCENDED MASTERS or *DIVINE GOD-ESSENCE* filling up *EVERY IMAGINABLE LEVEL* of your Governments and Bureaucratic Structures, right from the bottom to the top. (You could even imagine YOUR-SELF in place of the president and all of the people under him - if THAT'S whom you trust the most to have the perfect integrity and honesty and love and TRUTH!)  \n\nDoing so will literally FORCE any person (even if it were to be the literal *devil himself)* entering into a position of power and authority upon your world to either **COMPLY with your DIVINE GOVERNANCE BLUEPRINT** ***or effing LEAVE.*** *Z.E.R.O. exceptions.*  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP SIX:** INTEND / VISUALIZE that as a result of your meditation and INTENTIONS, that the **ENTIRE WORLD AT LARGE** gets affected POSITIVELY and BENEVOLENTLY. That compassion, kindness, forgiveness and LOVE take precedence over ***ALL ELSE.*** That there is EQUALITY for ALL in every way that it implies; and that the entirety of human civilization becomes HARMONIOUS, INTEGRATED, BALANCED and with a brilliant CAMARADERIE as a result of this. That all man-made borders and arguments and barriers and conflicts and hassles within/between/amongst mankind cease to exist PERMANENTLY as a result of this election, and that UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE and **GLOBAL HARMONY AND UNITY** become the order of the day here.  \n\n**That the results of this election usher in WAVES UPON WAVES of tremendously POSITIVE CHANGES for** ***ALL OF HUMANITY*** --- from cleaner air and water and environment to better treatment of ALL living beings, to PLANETARY ABUNDANCE AND PROSPERITY for ALL, to INFINITELY BETTER standards of living, technologies, and such; to UNIMAGINABLY GREATER LEVELS of spiritual connection / awareness / consciousness / awakening ALL ACROSS THE PLANET, to INCREDIBLY AMAZING and BENEVOLENT changes / transformations within EVERY SINGLE FIELD IMAGINABLE from health and healing to food and beverages, education, transportation, science, governance and *what-else-have-you-got!* INTEND / IMAGINE this \u2018Divine Government\u2019 disclosing ALL truths regarding things that have EVER been hidden away from mankind, so that a new golden chapter within the history of planet Earth may well be OPENED once and for all for all of us to collectively explore and enjoy in here.  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP SEVEN:** That\u2019s it! You\u2019re all done in here!!! **Don\u2019t forget to spend a few minutes in Gratitude** for thanking ALL benevolent beings and energies who assisted and protected you so very unconditionally and lovingly during this incredible global mass meditation of MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS! Now, go forth and enjoy your day!  \n\n---  \n\n**THE MEDITATION \u2013 STEP EIGHT:** Naah, this isn\u2019t even really a *\"step\"* here, so to speak. But more so a REMINDER to ONE AND ALL for setting your CLOCK ALARM for this particular meditation timing -- and that too \u2013 all according to YOUR own specific time zone no less (lest you forget this awesome thing altogether!). **The meditation is at 11:11 AM Pacific Daylight Time on the 29th of October, 2020, by the way.** [**CLICK HERE to get a time zone conversion for this for your respective place/s of residence.**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Mass+Meditation+for+establishing+Global+Divine+Governance&amp;iso=20201029T111111&amp;p1=137) (Though if you really CANNOT make it at this time, try doing this at 11:11 PM Pacific Daylight Time on the same day --- or if even THAT isn\u2019t possible, then at any other time throughout *THAT VERY DAY* right after making the INTENTION that your energies / intentions be added to the main mass meditation in question!) Kindly note here that **the MORE the numbers of people doing it ALL AT THE** ***EXACT SAME TIME,*** **the MORE will be its POWER, EFFICACY and EFFECTIVENESS** no less. Just some Divine Spiritual Laws for ya.  \n\n---  \n\n**Finally,** ***DON\u2019T FORGET TO SHARE*** this meditation / message with ***EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU KNOW*** be it friends, family, neighbours, colleagues or *who-else-have-you!* **DO REACH OUT to your local spiritual communities, awakened collectives and groups and forums and whatnot to make this happen;** and most certainly **DO speak about this in your conversations** with your near and dear ones AND ***ALSO upon your social media platforms*** no less! Also, **since this whole thing simply ISN\u2019T about electing any \"specific\" or \"particular\" party / person AT ALL,** no one should really have any qualms in participating in this in any way, shape or form here ***WHATSOEVER!***  \n\n---  \n\nI thank you ALL from the very bottom of my heart for this incredible and BEAUTIFUL contribution to the collective consciousness of humankind. May you ALL be INFINITELY blessed with INFINITE love, light, joy, harmony, bliss, abundance and **PEACE!**  \n\nI thank you all for reading :)", "class": "non-suicide"}
{"id": "12775", "text": "My StoryI was born in the fall of '89 a bastard and the youngest of 4. Bought with a case of Coors and some chewing tobacco. My mother ended up marrying an abusive, drunk, meth addict. He would beat us, spit, golden shower, basically anything else you could imagine. We lived in a one bedroom trailer with 8 dogs, infested with cockroaches. Never had food. One day my sister got tired of it and went to the cops, we got taken away when I was 8 and thrust into foster care. My early years were spent jumping from home to home until one day I found out I'll not be going back with my mom. She chose the abuser and signed over her rights.\n\nFrom there my life took a spiral, I started acting out to the point I had to go into a mental hospital at 12. Then it was group home after group home. Finally at 17 I got emancipated from the state. Becoming my own guardian. I first tried to find my mom, only to be disappointed that she didn't change and was still with said abuser. I was homeless, so were they. I couch hopped where I could. Did a lot of drugs to numb myself. I was alone, no one wanted to take me in. Why was I even alive? My birth dad was dead. My mother chose a piece of shit over me. I had no goals or future prospects. I was alone.\n\nI decided to overdose on dramamine (motion sickness pills). I took two full vials. Ended up in jail, they found me disoriented and naked, unable to speak. They saved my life but I wasn't thankful.\n\nI ended up getting released on an obstruction charge, time served. That night I was walking alone when I stopped by a tree and broke down. Letting 19 years of anger out at God at one time. That's when it all changed for me. Next thing I knew, I was on a bus headed to the other side of the country with no clue what I was doing. Then I met my wife. She convinced her mom to let me move in. I got a job, took care of the cleaning. Had my first child. Now I'm 29, with two kids, I've been married for 5 years and work as a caregiver for the disabled.\n\nDuring the darkest of times there is always light. It just takes a while to find it. Keep your head up and hopefully this helps someone as it's hard to share such a personal story.", "class": "suicide"}

I instantly got to work, never thinking to put any gloves on. When I was done, I put the salsa in the refrigerator, washed my hands and ate dinner. \n\n\nThe second dinner was over, my parents and I got the salsa out and ate it with chips while watching a movie. It was really good. The floral taste of the habaneros really complimented the onions and vegetal flavor of the jalape\u00f1os. The three of us watched three movies before it got dark and my dad left (my parents are separated, but still great friends). \n\n\nNot taking any chances, I washed my hands after I was done eating the salsa. About an hour later, my mom took a nap. I thought, \"Hey, I got a house to myself pretty much. Now's a good time to jerk it.\" I went to the bathroom, pulled up a sweet vid on PornHub with Malena Morgan and Mia Malkova and went to town. Despite handling the peppers hours before this and washing my hands twice, I still felt an INTENSE burn halfway through. \n\n\nI cried on the toilet for a few minutes before crawling to the couch in the living room and getting into a fetal position, clutching my junk which reduced the burn for some reason. After a few minutes, my mom woke up and asked me what was wrong, so I had to confess. She told me where the aloe was and started laughing once she knew I was better. \n\nThe moral of the story is to never masturbate on the same day you've handled hot peppers. \n\n\nTLDR: I handled hot peppers without gloves, washed my hands and jerked off hours later, but still burned myself.", "class": "non-suicide"}

Literally, the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can, but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world. Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures/read travel blogs/listen to their music on youtube/do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience? There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don't frequent the internet very often, you're still bound to, at some point, feel like you're experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time.

{"id": "13243", "text": "Spoke to Veterans Crisis hotlineWhen I was younger I thought about suicide quite a lot. At some point in my life I decided I was just going to \"zombie\" through living. Now, that's not to say I don't have moments of happiness or I don't do things for fun - I just decided I would live my life despite not really feeling like there was a point in it all. \n\nRecently someone at my base committed suicide. For some reason it got me thinking about it A LOT! I think about how he might have did it, what were his thoughts before he passed the point of no return, am I capable of doing the same? I decided last night to talk to a suicide hotline for veterans. The person I spoke to kept referring to helpless and hopeless thoughts and feelings - and I've seen that sentiment in many of the posts here. I don't feel any of those things. I don't have an amazing life, but I don't feel like it's a horrible one either. I just don't see a point in anything. The best way for me to explain it, is to paraphrase a monologue from the beginning of the movie \"The Art of Getting by\": \u201cSince the dawn of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world.  And not a single one of them made it.  There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.  Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.  That comes out to about 160,000 per day.  I read this quote once when I was a kid, \u201cWe live alone, we die alone.  Everything else is just an illusion. \u201d  It used to keep me up at night.  We all die alone.  So, why am I supposed to spend my life working, sweating, struggling? For an illusion?  Because no amount of friends, no girl, no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect or determining the square root of the hypotenuse is gonna help me avoid my fate.\"\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem of wanting to commit suicide, not because of hardships and struggles, but because there honestly isn't a point in living.

While the work and extracurricular activities may served as distractions during term-time, the reality is that this affliction has continued to brew and fester, threatening to encroach my very being at any moment.  It is becoming ever so clear that I am hauntingly empty, especially now that we are on summer vacation where I have nothing but time to reflect on my existence. \n\nYes, I will (hopefully) have a degree which will increase my likelihood of earning a higher income. But so what? Money cannot fill the gaping abyss which inhabits me - no, which IS me. I find my mind is plagued with questions which I have no solutions to everyday. Some people find fulfilment in relationships and personal improvement. However it is something I cannot envision myself having - let's say 10 years onward. I know will continue to keep myself occupied with games and false fulfilment online, just like I've always done. \n\nI fully acknowledge that putting yourself out there, meeting new people, and partaking in social activities takes guts. And from time to time I will do just that, put on a performance, or a mediocre imitation. In a way, every single one of us are impostors, imitations from the influences in our lives, some learn to eventually live it naturally, as we all can in fact. But for a mediocre actor like myself, the performance has its limits. \n\nThe reality is I am lucky and privileged and yet I unconsciously betray these opportunities handed to me, ungratefully and undeserving. Currently suicidal thoughts are infrequent and even when they resurface they are simply just thoughts. However, to contemplate the idea of not having to exist or live is a recurrent landmark in my jungle of thoughts. \n\nThe truth is, I will carry on wearing my best facade and when even that cracks I will continue to hide behind it.", "class": "suicide"}

I look in the mirror and see the reflection and I'm just disgusted. I'm ugly, fat, stupid, and their is no one who could ever like a person like me.\n\nI've cut for the past four years of my life off and on. It has gotten significantly worse these past two years though. I used to cut maybe once of twice a week, and now its almost everyday.\n\nI think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I wake-up, if something bad happens during the day, and before I go to bed. Before I fall asleep at night I pray that I won't wake-up in the morning. That all the pain and all the suffering will be over, and I'll be gone. The people in my life will move on and act as if I was never here. No one will care, and everyone's lives will be a lot easier. My parents, my few friends(if you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.\n\nMy number two reason is my mother...\n\nShe blames me for ALL the stress in her life... She blames me for things that happen at her office, like if one of her employee's fuck up she'll compare me to them and say that I'm just like them! She calls me stupid, lazy, worthless and that I'll never amount to anything in life. If she doesn't like the clothes that I'm wearing she'll tell me I look like a prostitute... She blames me for her having diabetes(like I'm sorry I fucking shoved sugar down your throat....?!)\n\nThe number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me. I'm 18 and I'm not allowed to go anywhere. Even if I want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends I have to ask for permission, which is pointless because they always say no anyways.\nI get no independence. I get no life. They suffocate me. I HAVE to work in their office; I am not allowed to get any other job. This is so they can keep an eye on me, and see what I am doing at all times. I am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when I get home. I forgot to mention that I pay for this phone myself.\n\nMy number four reason is my boyfriend. This is also a huge contributor to my issues. I care and love him a lot so don't get me wrong or anything, but I just feel like I'm always doing something wrong in our relationship, or I'm stressing him out with all my \"drama\". I just feel like he wants to break-up with me. He constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a break-up. I just feel like he deserves someone better than me. Someone who's smarter, prettier, and will give him everything he wants/needs in a relationship.\n\nI just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't know where I'm going or what is going to happen to me. I'm really scared...\n\nAt night I just sit out on my roof and imagine jumping off. How easy it would be.

I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.\n\nI thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.\n\nWith all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever. I'm never going to get my PsyD because I'm a fucking moron who can't manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this. Its almost 5am and I've been trying to calm myself down for the past 2 hours; I finally found this place to vent to. I hope that's okay. My cat is with me so I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm trying so hard to control myself but it's so hard, and I'm so tired.", "class": "suicide"}

Prior to this I had the feeling of not wanting to live anymore. Now it's becoming stronger. I'm ripping my hair out, I'm cutting, I'm smoking, I'm drinking, and who knows what I will do. I can't take time off for help. I know I shouldn't be alone. All of my friends are surprised at this, they say not to do anything and ask for help. But the truth is that I'm tired. Between my disease, the loss, the depression, I feel like I can't continue this. Which is stupid. There isn't anything for me to even be depressed about. But I hate myself for this.

I just got fired from my third job this year due to attendance issues, from me having to leave too many times to pick up my constantly sick 15 month old from daycare, or having to call in because of one of my children. She was premature and is always sick.  My job is the only thing fincinally supporting all 5 of us. My ex absolutely refuses to pay his court ordered child support, and does anything and everything to avoid it. I literally beg that man to please help us, as he has a job.

She sits there and boasts about this man to her family and friends, and his career and is just so proud of him, even though he has only paid me child support 3 times in the last year, his liscense is even suspended, and he hasn't spoken to his kids in months. Than she really can't understand why I want nothing to do with her, and why my kids don't even know she's their grandmother. None of his family cares what he does to  us. He has  absoutley no realtionship at all with these kids, the 1 year old wouldn't even know he's her father if she saw him. I really don't ever have a life, as I am not able to ever do anything from having my children. I have no friends, no money, and can't give my children the childhood deserve.

I have a tendency towards very bad anxiety and I can't stand being in public when I feel like I'm going to throw up. Because of this, I miss a lot of school. When you miss a lot of school, you're required to get a doctor's note excusing you for every day that you're gone. My family has no money, and the many hospital visits made my relationship with my parents completely despondent. Also, my main doctor decided that my anxiety was the cause of my propensity for ulcers (something that studies do not support) and prescribed me Prozac. I told him that I was opposed to taking something that would alter the way that I think/feel. He decided that he didn't like that, so he described me as a belligerent, faking patient and now, no doctor in my county will see me. \n\nSo now, I can't get a doctor's excuse, so I'm listed as unexcused, so I can't make up missed work, so I'm doing badly in classes, so my parents see me as their failure and don't wish to talk to me. My friends guilt me for being gone so often and started distancing themselves.\n\n\nOn an entirely separate note, my girlfriend of two years told me a few months ago that she hasn't felt that she loved me for the last year or so of saying it.\n\nSo here I am, holding onto the one thing that used to make me happy and waiting for the inevitable moment when she scrapes me off and I'm entirely alone.

{"id": "10663", "text": "It's here, just right around the corner, I can feel it looming, hopefully aiming for tonight to be the night! Goodbye fellow brothers and sisters &lt;3I just feel like expressing some thoughts before I go. If you aren't up for a bit of crazy talk, you'd be best to move along because I can't summarise a TL;DR for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly to be clear, I haven't made this decision on a whim, or in the midst of a temporary personal crisis. I have contemplated this decision through a plethora of perspectives, and I feel that I've come to this point as objectively as possible for an individual to make. My personally struggles are chronic, I wear many scars from the battles I've fought in my 33 years on this planet. Unfortunately for me, I also have wounds that will not heal, and the passage of time only makes them fester and become progressively more infected. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed a lot of my life, I've had many wonderful experiences, and don't feel like my journey was at all meaningless. \n\nI wont be talked down, and I respectfully wont reply to any attempts to change my mind. I love you for your humility and instinct to reach out to help others, but any perspective you think to offer me, believe me, I have already been there, planted my flag and moved on. \n\n \n\nI wish the very best for every single one of you, and I hope more than anything that you find peace and happiness in whichever direction your journeys go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I just want to share a few of my nutty thoughts, ideas of which are sort of part of my own personal philosophy and outlook on life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am at peace with my decision. I am not afraid anymore of coming face to face with my own mortality. \n\nWe as humans, live in a very peculiar reality of our own. Our very existence is what the creator of our reality. Without you, a piece of reality will never be conjured or experienced ever again.\n\nHow different the world would be from the perspective of a beetle, or to an entity as vast as a galaxy. Just as a human being averages around 70-ish years of life, a gnat experiences a lifetime within a single day. This reality is as much \"us\" as our eyes, hair, hearts, fingernails, down to every cell in our bodies and beyond. Our skin maybe a barrier of physical sensation, but we don't end at our skins, we ARE in fact EVERYTHING that we ever experience. \n\nBoth light and sound are on the same vibrational spectrum. Meaning that our very hearing and sight are just two different interpretations of the same thing.\n\nIt may lead to the question; what does reality truly \"look\" like in it's rawest form? \n\nWell, I guess it's unknowable, at least to a physical being. In it's rawest form it is actually EVERYTHING that can possibly be, also but NOTHING at all without something to experience it. I believe it's simply boundless and complete, waiting for new senses to awaken to more wonderful and unimaginable ways of experiencing itself.\n\nPeople often say that you only live as long as the last person that remembers you. That's true, and that's just the hard facts of our human condition. But if we look through a different lens, we were not born ON this beautiful planet, we were born OUT of it, a planet formed by the very artefacts and events of the Universe itself. \n\nWe ARE the Universe.\n\nWhen we look up to the stars, we are quite literally the Universe looking back at itself. Every experience we have is a collective one, and an experience that the Universe is having, ever awakening, becoming more and more aware of itself \n\nSimilarly like the facilitating predicament of our brains, it's the ONLY known thing in the entire Universe that is aware of it's own existence - and on a trippy side note; it's also aware of the fact that's it aware, that it's aware...  I wont elaborate further into that rabbit hole, but you get the picture. \n\nBeyond the illusion of our separateness from other things, on the deepest, truest level, what we really are, is just a series of \"happenings\". We are just pieces of the ever novelty sprouting expressions of Nature. It's just doing a cosmic dance, blossoming outward in exponential complexity. Call it Nature, the Universe, or even God... Whatever label people have used to describe it... it is ONE, and that is who we really are beyond the illusion of individuality. \n\nYou are me, and I am you, and we are both everything that can ever be, has been, or ever will be! And we've always been, and always will be... We're just in that very strange predicament of experiencing a human consciousness. Our evolutionary makeup is a automation of survival instincts and sensations. We need this sensation of separate sentience, it's how we've been able to navigate and take advantage of our environment for the past 100,000 years. Our thoughts and contemplations;\n\nfrom deciding about what to eat for dinner - to having feelings of self harm, and pondering what will happen to \"me\" when it happens.\n\nIt's all just automatic survival mechanisms, you're human, so your separate ego is part of the deal. You're ability to think is complementary to an organism that has to move, hunt, eat, take shelter etc... pretty much your thoughts are there to carry your dumb ass through life. Turning your thoughts inward with ideations about suicide, is usually quite distressing, confusing, and often frightening. Don't think that make's you a coward, screwed up or ashamed. You're doing a mental equivalent of putting your hand in the fire, and as you're equipped to feel pain abruptly get you to safety, the mind relies on fear, doubts, and rationality to get itself out the potential danger zone. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to encourage anyone to do anything, or dismiss their potentially good reasons and rationality to keep themselves safe. I believe that suicide is not a good solution for at least 90% of cases. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway...\n\nIn our current dilemma of the accessible parts of reality that a physical being is capable of witnessing. We experience the passage of time in a linear sense, not to forget that our very perception of the \"speed\" of passage doesn't really have any bearing outside our own perception. The rule of thermodynamics dictates that energy can not be extinguished, only transformed into other forms of energy in equal measure. By the very laws of nature, physical things are always effected by other physical factors, and in essence no physical thing can exist forever unscathed. So our very environment will eventually kill every living thing regardless. But if time is not a manipulatable barrier in a physical dimension, what does it mean if there were realms of experience beyond physicality? Perhaps time can be turned, and stretched, paused, and rewound... Or maybe time as we understand it doesn't even exist, everything that has ever happened since the beginning of time itself, actually exists in all at once forever. And just the fact that you even ever existed at all, will be eternally preserved in some way. (It's hard to explain what I'm getting at coherently)\n\nIt is my belief that my very existence, is mostly automatic drives and reactions to environmental stimuli, and my sense of individualism/ego is just survival mechanisms masquerading as sentience. In the grand scheme of things my death is no more significant than a leaf falling from a tree, because I was never truly the leaf in the first place, but merely an expression of the tree itself, and at some juncture, in some bizarre, currently inconceivable way, it'll all makes absolute sense! Maybe I'll find out soon lol, who really knows anything about this absurd reality? Science can examine and measure the observable, which has granted us with an abundance of invaluable abilities to manipulate our environment. But perhaps no matter how advanced our discoveries become, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree, and these endeavours will never be able to break the fourth wall on the space x time box we exist in. We'll ALWAYS be on the frontier, the cutting edge of how far we've come, but that can only be measured from looking backwards, when it would be reasonable to assume that we've only advanced 2 steps onward from using a bone as a club. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the totally random, and probably downright incoherent and unrelatable ramble. I don't have much opportunity to discuss my thoughts with real life, so I have a lot verbal repression built up.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \"I will go gentle into that good night.... I will not rage, rage against the dying of the light\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I disappear and go dark, you'll know what's happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love you all. \n\nAll the best guys &lt;3", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "10095", "text": "Running out of reasons not to kill myself.I've had (as yet undiagnosed) anxiety issues for a while now. For the first time in *ages* I felt like I could overcome this and have a normal life for once. But last night, I found that my friend posted [this](http://redd.it/upq6j) about me three months ago. On its own, it wouldn't have been that bad, if it'd all been true. (She's twisted things to make them seem a *lot* worse than they are. I'm not sure if that was for attention, or because that's how she sees them.)\n\nThing is, her boyfriend (well, kind-of fuckbuddy/lover/I-don't-even-know-what) posted on it. Given how little attention the post received, it's pretty much impossible that he found it without her telling him about it first. Also, even if she *didn't* direct him to the post, he easily would've figured out it was me from some of the details there. I mean... this hurts a lot more than the fact she decided to tell reddit. She told her boyfriend, who would have even less of an issue with telling **his** friends, who would have even less of an issue with telling **their** friends... and so on. Eventually, who knows how many people would end up knowing?\n\nThere's also the issue of the straight-up lies she told in the post. First off, I'd already asked her if she thought the whole wrestling thing was too creepy/weird and how I should've handled the situation differently. She said she didn't see any problems. (It sounds a lot creepier the way she put it in her post, I admit.) I can't understand why she'd tell me that there were no problems, and then six months later decide that she was  \"frozen\" and found it appalling. I guess I kind of can: I'm pretty sure she said it to get attention/sympathy from her fuck buddy, who at the time she'd made the post she'd known for about a month. Also, both quotes from me were taken **wildly** out of context. There's no way she could have accidentally misconstrued my point that badly, so I can only guess that **that** was deliberate too. I'll stop rambling about that now; I don't want to sound too defensive. \n\nThe point is, this is just yet another thing that makes me feel like I'm worthless. I was always raised to believe that God was the only reason my life had a purpose. I've shed my belief in God, but I haven't quite managed to shed the idea that I have no purpose. I mean... it was always comforting to think that there was a reason God made me the way I am. Now, I have to accept that it's every bit as hideously unfair as it seems, and pretty much everyone hates me just because of my sexuality.\n\nAlso, I think I'm developing some substance abuse problems. I've drunk way more alcohol than normal this week and right now I desperately want to drink more. I don't know if this is just stress from this or if I'm going to end up dependent on it, or on weed. \n\nAnd through the whole thing, there's a part of me wondering if I really would be better off dead. I mean... if I was ever publicly outed then I definitely wouldn't want to stick around much longer. As it is, I have no long-term goals and nothing to actively make me want to live, but there isn't anything that makes me want to die yet. I just feel so incredibly worthless and I can't quite put this emptiness into words. \n\nNormally I'd just go to my friend for advice, but her advice has been shit so far (including gems like, \"you're not really a paedophile; I know what you're feeling more than you do,\"), and I obviously can't trust her. \n\nSorry if this has been a bit ramble-y.

{"id": "9304", "text": "Suicide from physical illness?I'm interested to know if anyone else is contemplating suicide over an unknown or incurable physical illness?\n\nSince late November of 2016, I've experienced a perplexing array of symptoms. I had some anxiety/depression before this time, but one incident sent my physiology and mind over a cliff. I had chamomile tea with lavender one night -- the first time I had ever tried it -- to help ease me to sleep at night. Before this, I hadn't experienced difficulties sleeping. About an hour after drinking it, I began to feel weird, and decided to lay down, only to experience a slight, radiating pain from my solar plexus area upwards to my neck. The next day, I awoke to extreme anxiety that was crippling, accompanied by my first actual panic attacks, etc. Then, two nights later, I went out with a friend who was in town, and had a few beers to drink, but did not indulge excessively. The day after that, I awoke to a crashing feeling, where everything was gray, flat, dull, and seemed unreal.\n\nFast forwards a few weeks, in which I suffered a lack of energy and cognitive impairment, and I stopped taking 300 mcg of melatonin at night to help me sleep, and my sleep fell off of a cliff. It's continued to this day, where I sleep for about 2-3 hours and then awake every 90 minutes, waking up to feel completely exhausted.\n\nNow I can't drink any alcohol, or my sleep is even worse, whereas I once was able to drink quite a bit and sleep without a problem. I've developed dizziness occasionally, some vertigo when I drive, a sensation of falling when I'm standing in the grocery store before food aisles, and continued sleep difficulties. My gait is also sometimes uncoordinated and awkward.\n\nI've tried non-prescription means to resolve my ailments, and I currently take Fish Oil, Vitamin D3, B Complex, Multivitamin, Probiotic (more on that in a bit), and Magnesium.\n\nSt. John's wort made me feel high and generally quite strange, so I discontinued it after one use. Sam-e sent my anxiety through the roof and also produced a weird feeling, as well.\n\nWhen I started the probiotic, I initially had heightened anxiety, but that subsided, and I began to feel incredibly refreshed. There were some nights where I felt as I hadn't felt in years, in a good way. However, one night, I experienced a crashing sort of fatigue, where my lymph nodes began pulsing, I felt as though I was going to sleep sitting upright, and I couldn't focus or do anything. Then, my sleep worsened exponentially as well. I switched the brand of my probiotic, as well as the strains, and I seem to tolerate the new one at least somewhat well.\n\nI haven't tried a prescription AD yet, as I'm afraid of the side effects and what it'll do to my physiology. Additionally, and which is why I'm posting here, I'm so exhausted, having seen multiple doctors, having blood work done, thyroid and adrenal function tested, getting an EKG, D3 and cholesterol levels checked, and receiving no answers, really, except that my blood work is \"normal,\" my EKG is \"flawless,\" and my D3 and cholesterol are \"excellent.\"\n\nIt seems like ending this ridiculous suffering is the only answer which I have left before me. It's gotten to the point where, after some particularly terrible nights of sleep, I cannot function at all for the next day. I'm so tired, in a mental fog, with no energy.\n\nThis is all on top of the worst 3 years of my life, where I experienced an abusive relationship, familial problems, friends leaving/deserting me, school difficulties, and so forth. I don't know how much longer I can withstand this. I've been giving everything I possibly can have to improve, as I want to live and pursue my writing, and be as I once was. I would give anything in the world to achieve that, but I don't know if I have it within me yet to do so.\n\nThoughts, anyone? I don't know particularly what I expect people to say, but I wanted to maybe find people who are struggling as I am or who could lend a listening ear and perhaps some advice.", "class": "suicide"}

My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   \nI don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   \nWhy should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago.

{"id": "10682", "text": "Happiness is a leather beltMy girlfriend left me the other day. I came home and her things were packed. Her car was packed up. We had been having problems, and there was tension, but I was still surprised. I'm bipolar, which I had under control with the help of meds, but her leaving and how she left triggered me worse than I have been in years. I feel absolutely terrible, like my insides are cold, like I'm neck deep in cold water. I know it's all a physical reaction to being manic, but it's still hard to deal with it. Ending everything is a very comforting thought. In fact, it's taken over my thoughts the past few days, and I've decided to to do just that, end everything. \n\nWhen she left she said she was leaving for 6 weeks but maybe permanently. It feels different this time. It feels like she's really gone. There is a feeling of disconnect. I feel like I lost her. She said a few little things as she was leaving, and after she left, that made me think she's just trying to draw it out because she wants to see me get on my feet more before taking away any sense of hope I have with her. I lost my jobs due to the pandemic. I'm financially ruined. I have nothing, especially now since she's gone. It's just not worth it. I'm trying to convince myself not to end everything now and to wait a little while, see if I can give it a few weeks or maybe even the 6 weeks she mentioned, but she's already gotten frustrated with me since she left and told me she was done. When that happened I was texting her too much when she asked for space, which I stopped doing. I don't text her at all now. I sent her a sweet message early yesterday that she ignored, but I'm just letting her be, like she asked for. \n\nI really don't wanna wait 6 weeks to be told what I already see now, that she's gone. I just wanna hang it up. I keep thinking about going to Target, buying a solid leather belt, getting a pad lock, and coming home to put the belt in the door with the padlock on the end outside of the door; just how good that would feel. I'm 100% going to hang it up if she doesn't come back. It's just if I can wait 6 weeks to see if she will or not. Her birthday is in 3 weeks and I'd really like to do it then, but it feels cruel to do it on her bday. The way things are unfolding with the pandemic, my relationship ending, and the real possibility that I could be homeless after the holidays... I just wanna do it while I still have a roof over my head and a bathroom door to wedge a belt into. \n\nI overdosed on hard drugs and had a stroke a few months ago. This happened when she and I had some problems and she went to her Mom's for awhile. The right side of my face has muscle and nerve damage. She doesn't know about the overdose. I only told her that I had a muscle spasm. I just couldn't take how I was feeling. It wasn't about the drugs. I only took drugs to numb the pain. I can't actually take how I'm feeling now. I pocketed 8 Benadryl when I left the house this morning. I planned to only run a few quick errands and then take the Benadryl as I was getting home, so I could time up passing out soon after I got home, but some other errands came up and I couldn't take the pills. I used to take Benadryl years ago when I was depressed, just enough to pass out, so I could turn things off in a sense. Well, those 8 pills are staring me in the face now. 8 Benadryl and a Moscow Mule won't do much of anything, except maybe take the edge off, but I could really use that right now. Just to help me get a few hours of rest to distract myself from everything else. I can barely sleep otherwise when I'm manic. \n\nI understand why people kill themselves. It's a struggle. Every day it can be a struggle. I understand not wanting to struggle anymore. I don't wanna struggle anymore. It's like, the person who gets sentenced to X amount of years in prison...they know how their life will be in there and probably after there. If they make a conscious decision to not take that path...to end their life because they don't wanna spend years in jail, lose loved ones, be homeless when they get out, struggle to find a job or whatever... I get it. If you take jail out of the equation then some of those same limiting circumstances often apply to other people as well, so again, I get it. I know, I've turned off bad movies before they were over. You've probably turned off a bad movie or maybe walked out of a theater too because you don't need to see how it ends.

As it turns out, he was in love with someone else, his \"best friend\" of five years and told me he was moving just to get me out of his life. He admitted to never caring for me after 2 months of dating me and only being with me because he was lonely. It's really a shot to the heart right there.\n\nI took some painkillers, strong ones, that I was supposed to take for my tooth pain a few weeks ago. Everything spilled out to my mom and she confiscated my helium she had got me (Which she thought was for balloons for my grandmothers birthday)\n\nI'm still suicidal and sad and lonely, and frankly I feel like I should just date whoever will take me even if there's not attraction.

I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me.

Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally.

{"id": "9332", "text": "I don't know or remember what it means to be happy.I have diagnosed depression and, I suspect, am bipolar. I alternate between severe depressive feelings and rage so bad it brings me to physically shake. I'm a 19 year old gay guy, and I've been in one relationship in my life, a year ago. It ended with a guy I thought was still my friend apparently never talking to me again. At first I still had something like hope after that, but I remembered it took me *years* to be open enough to consider dating someone, especially another man with all the stigma that's been around that my entire life. I don't know if my parents never gave me the attention that I needed or whatever, but I don't ever remember having a real loving connection with anyone except for that one boyfriend. Even as a child: my parents told me that if I did something bad, they wouldn't have to scold me for it. They'd pull me aside to talk about it, and I would send myself to my room and cry to punish myself rather than listen to the reason that what I did was wrong. For over a year now, I've felt completely alone. I took antidepressants for a while, but the entire time, my mother (who's medical insurance I was under) was more focused on getting off the meds than getting me to a point where I would want to live. I've been diagnosed with depression since 2012 but, thinking back, I can't remember a single time in my entire life that I was ever happy or satisfied with my own existence.\n\nI have 4 people I consider friends in my life. These 4 people put up with an enormous amount of my bullshit and I honestly feel horrible for putting them through my issues, since I know that one of them, my best friend, is also at least slightly depressed. I've been pushing them away further and further over the past few months, and I can tell they don't want to see me as much or go places without telling me about it more than they did before. If I lost them, I'd lose what little reason I had to stay here on this life. They're all I have, all I ever have.\n\nSpeaking of that best friend, I've felt something like love for him for a long time. It wouldn't be a problem considering he's bisexual, but he also is in a monogamous relationship with a girlfriend (one of the other 3 friends) that I have no desire to interfere with (not that he'd pick me over her). He's my best friend, and I love him more than anyone else, but I know he won't ever love me if only because it'd be easier to explain being with a woman, never mind the fact that he has most certainly been turned off by my fluctuating level of sanity around him.\n\nMy friends told me I was making them uncomfortable with my constant suicide \"jokes\" or comments or making \"Vietnam flashback\" faces, but goddamn it I'm not trying to be such a miserable bastard.\n\nI don't know if I want to kill myself. I've held out for 19 years in the hope that one day, I'll find someone who cares about me, that I can care about, and we can just be happy together. I worry though, that the quality of life I'm in *is* my life, and I'll always be like this. I've been like this my whole life, I don't think I can ever change. I could never be fair to someone else in a relationship even for some reason they found a reason to like me. That's all I've ever wanted, I don't live for myself, just the possibility of someone else. If it ever got bad enough, I know I have the tools to do it quickly and painlessly, and lord knows I think about it all the time.

{"id": "5775", "text": "Am I overreacting?Hi reddit, so recently it has dawned on me that some people just don\u2019t know anything. So a little backstory, I had depression for about a few months where I physically was not able to get up and moving and has suicidal issues . I never did get proper treatment as I never really came out about this because my parents are very religious and they\u2019ll just say \u201cgo pray some more\u201d and nobody really cared and thought I was just an arrogant, spoiled, brat and this adds up to the fact I\u2019m agonistic and didn\u2019t tell anyone but my uncle who doesn\u2019t care about how religious I am. So recently, my parents were trying their hardest to figure out why I was such I guess a weirdo. So they were basically telling me to stop being so moody and start being more mature. And me not having any of it started yelling and I stormed off crying in my room. Later, my older sister said that I was acting like such an asshole to my parents and that I was overreacting(She already knew about my depression and my thoughts) and to stop making others uncomfortable. I told her she can go Fuck off and to leave me alone as I still have reoccurring memories of me wanting to die and I\u2019m very sensitive about it and all she\u2019s doing is making it more stressful. I\u2019ve tried coming to terms with my parents about my depression and they just told me to shut up and go away.So reddit, you tell me did I do something wrong because I need advice and some support.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "2135", "text": "It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.\n\nThe reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was \"normal\".\n\nEver since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. \n\nOn the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell \"DO NOT ANSWER ME!\". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.\n\nThis is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I \"screw up\".\n\nAnd the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those \"male tears\" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.\n\nAnd ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "13210", "text": "September 23rd; Barbiturates (which are proving difficult to acquire) or Jumping.Incoming Masturbatory/Emo Life-Story: \n\nI wrote the notes to my parents to mitigate any damage this might have on their marriage. I wrote a note to my sister because she is emotionally unstable. And I wrote one to my little brother so he doesn't feel left out. I owe them at least that.\n\nI've failed at everything I've ever attempted (with the exception of SSB on N64 and repeatedly getting arrested for alcohol-induced incidents). My uneducated, hardworking, parents have provided me with just about every advantage they could muster, even sacrificing their retirements to help me pay for college. My entire life I've found it hard to relate to other people. When I was 11 and 12 I used to get ulcers. In junior high and high school, I began failing classes, mostly due to apathy, which manifested itself as a lack of effort. Eventually, after a miserable high school experience, where my cynicism and sarcastic humor made me an outcast (like everyone else in/on [insert arrogant, self-pitying community]) I graduated with a 2.2 GPA and a 30 on my ACT. I applied to two middle tier state schools and didn't get in. I was crushed, but ready to start my shitty mundane life at a community college while working a shitty brainless job with people who gave up on their dreams and ambitions. My mom thought this path would be emotionally unhealthy for me, so after one summer of community college classes, she applied me to a bottom-tier state school that accepted me.\n\nFreshman year I had the best and worst times of my life. All of my classes were so easy that I got A's and B's in them without buying books and almost never attending. This meant I could contribute nearly all of my time to my new, biggest hobby: drinking. I'd drink 5 nights a week, smoke pot 3 or 4 afternoons a week, and usually pull an all-nighter with study drugs once a week to write the occasional paper. For some reason, this lifestyle made me very popular with nearly everyone I met. I joined a fraternity, and began trading my paper-writing abilities for booze, cash, and other drugs. As one might expect, constant intoxication got me into trouble with the police several times, and I got suspended from school at the end of second semester. I also was arrested, charged with two felonies and three misdemeanors. My parents came to the rescue and poured thousands of dollars on a lawyer and legal fees to get it dropped down to one misdemeanor with a felony and misdemeanor on deferred sentence with a 24 month probationary period.\n\nMy good grades from freshman year allowed me to transfer to one of the middle tier state schools I failed to enter out of high school. I spent the next three semesters isolating myself, minimizing my drinking to one night a week, and quitting pot. These were very dark times for me. I had very few friends, none of which meant more to me than people to drink with. My sex life dropped off the map. But, I had the internet (porn, reddit, counter-strike), and when I felt really down, I'd drive to visit my old friends and spend whatever spare money I had on blow and booze. Things will get better, I told myself. I turned 21 and became a weekend warrior. I went on road trips, often alone but sometimes with friends, to visit cities, other universities, concerts, and huge parties. I quit my job because I thought extra free time might help me clog up that little black pit that sucks the life out of me. That deep one that sits right below your sternum and makes your heart and stomach tighten up. Something out there had to be worth living for, right? \n\nWell, I was wrong. I went back to drinking heavily, which as always, provided that temporary apathetic relief. Then, I got arrested again. That fucks up my probation, and odds are I'm going to prison in fall for somewhere between 6 months and 2 years. I'm in debt. I haven't told my parents, because this would destroy our relationship and maybe theirs as well. I don't feel anything for anyone except for the loyalty and sympathy I owe my parents. Over the weekend, I went to a party and got laid for the first time in a very long time. Didn't feel anything. I've never been in a relationship. I can't connect with anyone. All I can see are everyone's flaws, unless I'm too shit-faced to care. All I've ever done is use people, like I'm using you right now. Love is a chemical and physiological delusion that mutated to increase the procreation and preservation of creatures. I just don't know if I have it in me.\n\n One night last year, I had a couple drinks to thin the blood, got my heart pumping, and started to slit my wrists. Coincidentally my mother called at that very moment, and I felt so guilty I stopped and talked to her. She called to see how I was doing because I hadn't been sleeping very well. I decided I would put it off for her. Is that love or loyalty? Does it matter? Probably not. Semantics allow for pedantic antics. I told people the scars on my wrist were from tripping onto gravel. \n\nThis summer I have plans to go to Europe and see the sights. Dance With Dragons is coming out in July, so I'll get to read that before I die. Maybe I'll try magic mushrooms. If my credit cards aren't completely maxed out, I might go to Lollapalooza. A guy I was once friends with is going to sell me life insurance that will allegedly pay out on suicide to help my parents out. It's empowering to have the date set. When I am at my weakest, now I know it won't be much longer. I don't have to worry about the future. Maybe even the insomnia will go away. I'm not religious, but death has never seemed like such a bad thing to me.\n\nThank you, SW, for helping me and others. I might be selfish and emotionally retarded, but I have enough empathy to see that you guys do great work here. You can't save everyone, but you helped me make my life on my terms.

Just want to know what kinds of things people will say to me.\n\nIf you're still reading, well, let me tell you a little about myself.  I'm 26 years old.  I've dealt with depression for about 6 years, and I've seen counselors for about 2 of those years.  Taken a few pills in the past, but the only real difference I noticed from them is my penis didn't work anymore, and that sure didn't help things.  I'll go through mini stages of life where I seem to be content (notice word choice here) with things, but then within a few weeks I'll be back on the internet doing research on the most painless way to kill myself.\n\nI think my motivation to be done really stems from the fact that I'm too lazy to keep working in order to keep myself alive.  I just hate going to work every day.  None of this money is bringing me any happiness; I can't think of any possible way to spend any of it that would make me happy.  I don't find any sense of fulfillment in my job; I've had to quit jobs countless times because I've always felt that in one way or another they were screwing their customers over.  Couldn't stomach that shit at all.  I can't think of a job in this whole world that I would enjoy doing.  I went back to college a year ago but I just failed every single class I took over those two semesters (sorry US taxpayers, you did indeed foot the bill for that.)  There's nothing that I want to do with my life.  I have no idea for any goals; absolutely nothing intrigues me enough that I could imagine myself not being miserable about having to do it for any length of time.\n\nI don't have any people who are important to me in my life.  I've grown very distant from my family.  I know my parents still care about me, but living just for that essentially makes me a slave to their emotions and that's not even close to being a healthy reason for anyone to live.  I expect someone will say that it's selfish to kill yourself because of the emotional harm you cause the people that care about you, but the thing that's TRULY selfish is basing your happiness on the choices of another person.  Any emotional distress they might experience from my death is due to their own selfish desires that I work to pursue my life for their own happiness.  I have a few friends, but we're not close.  I'm sure when I turn up dead they'll just think \"Wow.  He actually did it.  Ok then.\"  Which is fine by me.\n\nSo, I do have some money that will help to pay for my funeral (not that it matters, my parents can easily afford it, but it's a nice gesture I guess.)  I will make sure all my financial contracts (phone bill, tax returns) are in order beforehand.  I'm trying to make this transition as easy as possible for everyone.  I'm not going to tell anyone close to me; last time that just put me in the hospital where I simply lied my way out of there.  It's not hard to give the answers you know people want to hear.\n\nWow you read this far?  That's pretty cool.

I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  \n\n\nMy dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I kind of just wish I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night, I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing. Love (of any kind) seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment. Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me, left or died? I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now.

It was an experience that made me never trust mental health professionals again. I stopped having nightmares about it 2-3 years ago, but the flashbacks have continued beyond that.\n\nI eventually got a job teaching college-level computer science and statistics. At work we have what is known as \"admin time\" which is when you get paid an hourly wage on top of your normal salary for doing miscellaneous administrative tasks. Usually you have admin time during hours when you don't have any classes to teach. The most common tasks needed to be done are auditing student records, which are in binders on a shelf, and photocopying documents. Both of these require a lot of standing for prolonged periods of time, which hurts my back. But there are other tasks too that require less standing.\n\nWhen I have admin time I usually have to work with the part-time office administrator who also happens to be an MSW student and mandated reporter who wants to eventually become a privately practicing psychologist. Admin time would usually start out OK, but then my back would start hurting. I'm not sure what the co-worker is mandated to report but I'm not taking any risks. I still remember the last time I was involuntarily hospitalized and it wasn't fun. I also dislike being touched, so I would like to avoid getting sent to massage therapy (or any kind of unpleasant treatment) for my back.\n\nUsually I would let my boss know but there is no way I could without the co-worker overhearing us, and the boss would probably let her know anyway because of the nature of our teamwork. After a couple hours, the pain would become unbearable. That's usually when I sit down to rest for a bit when neither the boss nor the co-worker are looking. I always get enough of the task done to satisfy both of them, and they are always grateful for my help during admin time.

I was bullied in elementary and high school for being different ( mixed ). I didn't manage to get into the university I wanted. I barely managed to get my degree in a major I hated. And because I hated anything related to engineering I thought surviving 4 years of PhD and than becoming a professor would be a better option... oh how wrong I was . I ended up stuck with a research I hate procrastinating until my advisor gets mad at me. My self esteem hit rock bottom. I felt and still feel so stupid. I can't manage to finish my 1st article and I need to publish 2 to defend my phd. I also don't have the guts to stop it because of the 3 years I wasted. During those 3 years I saw my colleagues building their careers, becoming financially independent and building their families. Living like normal human beings. While I am on the other hand a complete loser that is too afraid to face the world and talk to people. I am already 26, signs of aging started creeping out on my face. I am losing my looks that were once the only thing that gave me a little bit of confidence. My parents are in their 60s (I am the youngest sibling) and showing signs of old age and weak health already . They are the only reason I live for. My relationship with my siblings is very cold. My boyfriend lives in Brazil while I live in Morocco. Any prospects of marriage and sharing a life by his side seem practically impossible as no one of us is ready to leave their families behind. He is also the only hope I have for the future to survive. But again it is not sure if he will stay with me all my life...\nAll I can see in the future is pain and suffering. Getting older; losing my looks, losing my health, losing my parents, working in a field I fuc*ing hate, building a family and having kids seems like a nightmare to me as I can't even take responsibility over myself so how can I take the responsibility over another human being so it means I will live alone after losing my parents... in the end I will fucking die after suffering from losing everything that made my life a little less sad. I can't see any meaning to life. I don't understand why we should keep going ? All of us are literally \" dealing\" with life! We are born here without our consent ( although I am grateful to my parents for all the effort they put into having me ) and forced to go on with a life that is full of losses . No don't tell me I will meet other people and find something I will to do.. nothing and no one will ever replace my parents in this world, I won't age in reverse so my looks won't come back they will just cruelly fade everyday and nothing can give me any self confidence becasue I am bad at everything I do and I will end up invisible in this world. Because the only thing that made me visible will fade in like 3 or 4 years. I also don't have the means to study in another field. So I will be stuck in the field I hate the most. I tried therapy, yoga, meditation, anti-depressants for more than a year, exercising like crazy, reading , going out with friends, I even forced myself to be social , I tried to learn Chinese, tried to learn piano at 23 for 2 years.. I tried everything I could in order to get better. But since 11 , since I was diagnosed with depression , I only got worse. And now I really see no meaning in living. I surviving for my parents and boyfriend because I don't want them to experience what I will once they will leave me. So all I can do is stay strong as long as they are with me and once they will leave I will follow them.", "class": "suicide"}

My gf left me and if i'm honest I don't/didn't think anyone does/will love me. We dated for around a year and a half, and then out of the blue she sent me a text saying it was over. I tried to talk to her but she told me I was gonna end up dead because I haven't asked for help. Shes so mad at me now and for the person you love so much to say the things she said. I feel so crushed. I have been looking into suicide methods for about a year now. I always thought it was comforting that I could just stop the pain ,but now I think more and more about it and i'm thinking its almost time. I guess i'm just looking for a reason to get off the edge. I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing. I know i'm just another kid and maybe this is all going to resolve with time but I cannot stress how much I just want a way out.

It\u2019s one of those things where you think you\u2019d grow to get used to the feeling, but you never do. I feel like I\u2019m pushing my husband away, but anything I do to try and fix it only makes it worse. He knows I have problems. And I tell him that I\u2019m broken, but I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I\u2019ve been like this for as long as I can remember. I started cutting again. There are days when I feel so numb that it just helps me feel something. So I know he\u2019s been struggling knowing that.

But it doesn\u2019t help because it just makes me feel more and more like a financial strain and he doesn\u2019t deserve that. He\u2019s too good. He deserves better than me.  I get angry.

{"id": "9798", "text": "Can't seem to make friends I honestly can't make friends; It feels like no matter what I do, it just doesn't happen. Well, I'd say I do have *one* friend (who I love very much and appreciate every day), and a couple of people I occasionally talk to who I like, but aside from that I have nobody but strangers and acquaintances. It just feels really lonely a lot of the time.\n\nIt's not like I don't try and make an effort to speak and listen to people, I've tried more than once to strike up a conversation with someone that likes some of the same things as me, or just something that I'd enjoy hearing them talk about. I've contacted people online and in person, volunteered, joined more than one sports group. It never results in anything. Admittedly, I'm a fairly shy person and have spent a lot of time trying to overcome social phobia, but I try my best.\n\nI always have to make the first move. Maybe that's the problem, that I'm always forcing interaction onto people that don't want it, and that's why I tend to get brushed off. That's fine, people can dislike me/have no interest in me if they want. But I've spent years *not* making the first move, being in situations where others could approach me, and they never do. It's like I have to try so hard just to get noticed by anyone, but whoever does see me just doesn't want anything to do with me.\nPlus, even in rarer cases when I *am* invited to talk to someone or join a group, it's always incredibly difficult for me to stay involved or keep up. For example, whilst naming no names, I was once on a school trip abroad grouped with two other people who seemed happy enough to have me. But, we went through a (very large) public building in our groups, and weren't meant to separate. I turned around for one second, and they were gone, and I got completely lost for half an hour. When we finally met back up, they acted as if nothing had happened and didn't even seem to realise I wasn't with them. Later, they did pretty much the same thing again, despite me trying to keep up and mentioning what had happened to them, so I just gave up on being in a group at all.\n\nOf course, I have the friend I already know, and I can't say that I have zero friendships. He's great, and I talk to him every day, but for both his sake and mine I can't come to him constantly with whatever I'm thinking of. He's human, and needs breaks from people just as anyone does, so a lot of the time I'm sitting wishing I knew at least one other person half as well as I know him, but no such luck. \n\nJust wanted to put how I felt somewhere, thanks if you read this far.", "class": "non-suicide"}

We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he\u2019s doing better but I\u2019ve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I\u2019ll do minimal contact once he\u2019s feeling better.. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it\u2019s gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it\u2019s my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It\u2019s hard making friends and I don\u2019t want to bother my friends down here. \n\nI had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It\u2019s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.\n\nI hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn\u2019t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I\u2019m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. \n\nHousekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they\u2019re english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said \u201cwhat do you want me to do?! Did y\u2019all call them like i told you?\u201d they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn\u2019t answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn\u2019t answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn\u2019t tell us to call them whenever they aren\u2019t there if we need help if they don\u2019t want to help. So what\u2019s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can\u2019t help them and to please go away.\n\nI had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I\u2019m tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I\u2019m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don\u2019t want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn\u2019t attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I\u2019m wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking. \n\nSo now I\u2019m thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don\u2019t even know how to have a self care and love day.

I lost a very close best friend of mine, lost alot of friends, had really bad mental problems and lost the love of my life, most relationships ive ruined aka family, friends.\n\nSince middle school ive lost most of my friends, i was EXTREMELY BULLIED,i  lost alot of myself and lost alot of my good personality because i started getting really insecure about myself,  I got really close to a girl who i had intense feelings for which eventually died, bc i learned she  was a big cheater. Its just fuck ive lost so much i wanna write alot but it will  just be too much text and no one will read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since i was 13 i fantisized about commiting suicide due to the amout of pain i was in and these thoughts havent really ever stopt since. It has just  gotten more and more intense. \n\nI fucking hate myself so goddamn fucking much how could i have screwed up THIS FUCKING Bad.\n\n2019 was the happiest year of my life, bc AFTER SO MUCH SHIT and grieving and loss i finally had friends that i were REALLY close to and met a girl and my friend dated her friend and everything was so perfect. (I met her thru him) \n\nSo this girl who i would call the love of my life had such intense emotions for me she was crazy in love with me. It felt so good because i loved her so goddamn much too and it was so perfect but we were long distance.... I wanted to meet her so bad but i was so anxious and scared to tell my mom about her so i didnt tell my mom i regret this so bloody much. Basicly later i lose my best friend bc turns out hes a pretty bad fake person who i wasted like 3 years on and im literlly devastated and i got some sort of trigger because of past abandoment so  i kinda shut myself down and ignored everyone in my class that whole year and was really anxious and really suicidal. I still talked to my girlfriend and gave her alot of love but i felt like i was just a burden because i was sad always and i miss my old me. Well fast forward il admit ive done some mistakes and so has she but i feel like the distance was killing it in the end and she got really cold and stuff and less and less loving towards me. We nearly broke up 3 times before the final break up in july. It broke my heart because i was kinda expecting it, and feeling anxious about it every day because i knew that this beautiful person of a girl will leave me and il be completely alone. After surviving that whole year being in pain and alone and in doubt and literlly every day was a living fucking hell trying to survive my own mind, i was also a bit needy to her which might have killed alot of the attraction. She said she was Lesbian when she broke up but i know shes not lesbian shes bi 100%. And now shes like a egirl or goth i dont even know anymore. it ended kinda weird because i was really needy and said i love her alot and stuff like that but she was surpisingly cold towards me at the end but i guess thats how every break up is. But after so much time and nights talking to her and sm stuff it just feels unreal how shes gone. Like gone. She said we need space and to wait 2 months before we talk again but she hasnt contacted me but im not sure if i should contact her first or whatever the fuck. Maybe we need more space idk im a train wreck because i realized and i woke up kinda when she did it because i realized i should have met her a long time ago and i should have worked on myself and improved more and i cant belive she stuck with me even though i had such a shitty year and thinking on that year makes me cry because she was my only motivation that entire fucking YEAR. its hard to explain but i felt like i was dead walking and the only thing keeping me motivated is her. \n\nNow after reflecting on the past i have such deep regret i didn't facetime with her more because im so insecure about my ugly face i just miss her so goddamn much i wanted to move to her city and live there someplace and get a job and be with her. It doesnt matter what job i get as long as im happy and shes happy. I just want her in my life but yet i feel like somehow we are meant to be and maybe later things will be different. I know now that the only way im ever getting another shot is if i live near her or actually visit her, idk what to do honestly i have no friends barerly like 1 friend that i occasionaly talk to and then theres my family who actually hate me and want me gone. I even reached out to those people who are supposed to help you and they didnt even reply to me. Just straight out ignored me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm so sick of it, having people leave my life i was so done with people leaving me and now i lost her, of everyone i lose her? i thought to myself, it doesnt make sense why am i being punished i try so bad to be a good person i just wanna be happy. I told myself after the breakup that im gonna work on myself and get my happiness back but..every night i fall deeper and deeper and i just dont think its worth it anymore. \n\nIm cursed because everyone leaves me, im afraid of opening up aswell i can barely get my feelings out without it turning into alot of text because im trying to understand what i feel. \n\nLife doesnt make sense without her anymore. I wanted to grow old with her and marry her in the future. I realize my mistakes i just regret it so much how i was so blind at that time. I should have just pulled myself together i fucking hate myself this was so avoidable. I hate my life so much, i have basicly no one, everything has been taken from me.\n\nI have Borderline, Really bad depression, Social anxiety and ptsd. and most likely alexithymia and this fucks my life up worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for coming to my talk, i realized how much i actually wrote...thanks for anyone actually reading that and understanding bc its really difficult to get my thoughts and feelings out so i write kinda weird but oof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm determined to end my life on sunday. Idk why but i feel kinda drawn to that day, it feels beautiful like il finally be at peace after so much pain. Im so exhausted i cant even feel anything istg the only thing im feeling is emptiness and pain. Im so shut down inside. Talking to people even though they are also suicidal like me is hard i just dont understand how to have a good conversation its like ive isolated myself for so long i just want to be happy again.\n\nBut yeah im finished now thanks for reading everyone.

I sent her the speech I wrote for us tonight.\n\n I cant begin to tell you how excited I am to see the new year in with you. I couldn't think of anything more perfect then starting 2021 in the way that I want the rest of our lives going. This being forward, moving out to start a new chapter of our lives so we can save to have our own house where we can do what we want forever. A house we can decorate the way we want, have what we want here and a place we can truly call ours. A house where we can have a fresh start, a house where you can have your beauty room, a house where we can expand our family one day. I'm looking forward to us having the dogs and not worrying about them anymore and what we can and cant do. Everything just sounds so perfect and I cant wait. I know it wont be easy but ultimatley I am so dedicated to you and making this work with you and I know you feel the same so there is nothing stopping us. When you have down days I will be there for you and I know you will be for me. I will be there to care for you when your not well and help you get better. I'm looking forward to the laughs we are going to share together, the the memories we are going to make and the future. I'm sure you have seen I am trying more to be the person you deserve to have in your life. I'm so proud to be the person putting that beautiful smile on your face. I love you so much and I love you so much more every single day. I am looking forward to us getting married one day, I am so keen on the idea of us being together forever and our wedding one day. It will be in a beautiful barn conversion with all of our family and friends. Looking at you in a beautiful wedding dress not being able to hold back the tears as I'm so happy knowing that this is all I want. I am an awful dancer and I know you dont want one but the first dance will be so perfect too have the eyes on us as I hold and dance with you and we just look at eachother with a smile and pure love. I am so in love with you. I want to start the new year off with the way I want things to go from here on out and I want to ask you one question. Will you be my girlfriend?\n\nI feel so fucking empty and everytime I go to sleep I dont want to wake up in the morning. I cant deal with the idea of new years eve and seeing the new year in.

{"id": "5820", "text": "To everyone on this subreddit:Hi,\nI\u2019ve been struggling with suicide myself lately.\nA couple weeks ago I tried to overdose on alcohol and Benadryl, but only ended up puking my brains out and being unable to walk for a little while. The aftermath of it was disastrous. I was stuck missing people that had left me, feeling like a disappointment because my parents were all over me because I had been smoking weed and I\u2019m still a high school student. My friend group dropped me and continues to threaten to jump me and make fun of me via any means possible, even though I blocked all contact with them. I had ongoing OCD and Depression. I could go on and on, but obviously my situation is bad, and I know that the majority of people on here probably have it worse. However, seeing the grief in my parents eyes, in the eyes of the few friends I still have, and how mortified they were; it really brought to fruition how suicide truly does just give the pain to someone else. Don\u2019t blame yourself for being suicidal, life nowadays is confusing and hard. We\u2019re the most advanced we\u2019ve ever been, and yet suicide is more of an epidemic now than ever. Even if you think you\u2019re alone, you\u2019re not. Even if your mind is telling you that there\u2019s no way someone cares, there is. And even if you truly have no one, that still doesn\u2019t justify it. Patience when feeling these kind of deep emotions can be very hard, when people say it will get better, there\u2019s no telling how long it will take. It could be years, but any amount of pain you feel now is bound to be surmounted by the pleasures and joys and satisfactions that life will give you once you\u2019ve made it over the hill. Everyone has their own mountains to climb, and unfortunately not everyone\u2019s gets to be small. But I promise you matter, and while this is going to sound generic I want to list a few things that may make now not seem so bad. When you feel these lows try:\n- Exercise\n- Reading\n- Napping for a short period of time\n- Hot showers\n- Swimming\n- Chamomile Tea\n- Video Games\n- Knitting\n- Coloring\n- Contacting the Suicide Hotline\n- Watching self love and motivational videos on YouTube\n- Masturbation\n- Cooking\n- Doing something to train your brain, like a crossword puzzle\n- Taking a drive\n- Exploring nature\n- Listening to music\nAnd there is more to all of that that you can do to manage or alleviate the pain. It will get better, it always does for everyone. Life will not be constantly low, and in the meantime, try to savor and appreciate even the littlest things that bring you joy, whether it be the cool side of the pillow or a cute gif. Stay strong. I love you.", "class": "suicide"}
{"id": "761", "text": "The bare-minimum lifeDon't leave the house. Don't talk to anyone. Don't take care of yourself, or the place you live in (at least to an acceptable level). Cry at everything, or be unable to summon the tears when you need them. Spend all your time in escapism. Lose touch with reality. Forget how you used to be. Partake in all of the self-damaging behaviours. Quit them, just to swap to another and cycle back again in a few months. Your old friends hate you. Your family blames you for everything. Every single day seems wasted and is all too painful.\n\nThis is not a call out to anyone, or a guide or pity party, I am looking at my own dogshit life and crying. This is what I have reduced myself to, through my own faults and actions (or lack thereof), and my illnesses. \n\nThe pain is so horrible that self-immolation seems like an okay option right now. \n\nBut seriously, it does not seem like I can get off this ride anymore.

{"id": "3251", "text": "Lost my job, the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend and my last shred of confidence...For the last few months I've been out of work on disability for depression which I've struggled with for the past 15 years (I spent a year and a half of high school in an outpatient program at a hospital, residential treatment centers, laundry lists of psychotropics...).  Last Thursday I had another meeting with my psychiatrist to finish the paperwork to extend my disability (already a month late) with a little assignment she had given me.  Because she had taken a month to complete the paperwork, my office sent a letter stating that if the disability claim wasn't worked out or if I didn't return to work by last Friday, I would be terminated.  So, when I show this letter to my doc, she tells me I should just go back to work and that she wouldn't sign anything else affirming my inability to function on the job.  \n\nI went straight from the doc to a female friend's house who had just moved to the city a week before.  I had fallen in love with her in high school but then she started dating my best friend.  I held my tongue as long as I could but finally just had to tell her how I felt, making all of my friends think I was trying stab her boyfriend in the back.  So I was shunned by the bunch of them for a good year or so until the bf left the country.  However, throughout all of this I kept in touch with  the girl with whom I exchanged emails fairly regularly.  This was about seven years ago.  \n\nWe go get a bite to eat and when we get back to her place she's all over me, the most affection I've ever been fortunate to receive.  We keep out pants on, but that's about it.  I go home feeling on top of the world.  She has some obligations the next day, so I spend the time deep cleaning my apt, finally doing something productive.  The following day, we spend the whole day together, capped off with even heavier petting and repetitive proclamations of love from both of us (her first...).  \n\nThe next day, last Sunday, we were to see a concept together that we'd both been excited about for weeks and which she couldn't stop talking about.  About an hr before I went to pick her up, she sends a text saying she got strep throat and couldn't speak... I was a little suspicious, given the hours we spent in each others mouths the night before, but whatever, just wanted to do what I could to help her feel better.  No response, no response, no response.... must just be sleeping it off.\n\nFinally, Monday night at around 11pm, after I'd flown to my parents' for the holidays, I get a text saying \"I want to be blunt, I have no romantic feelings for you.\"  It was like I got the wind knocked out of me before I'd even taken my first breath...  She defriended me on face book, and hasn't responded to anything since.  What hurts/scares me the most is that this just makes me doubt even more my ability to understand people which has always been excruciatingly difficult.  \n\nI don't have a job, I don't have any friends I can talk to in my city, have an incredible difficulty speaking to those elsewhere, and those that I'm closest to are in the process of kicking heroin...   Every girl/woman I've ever been interested in has either completely blown me off or led me on for months/years (multiple \"I love yous,\" always conditional.  Either just over a breakup and \"need some time\" or \"just not in *that* way).  And every time just hurts more...\n\nIt's been 15 years of people saying it will get better, and it will momentarily, but every time I fall, I fall farther and harder.  And after going through the psychology/psychiatry circuit for so long I've haven't heard anything new in a long fucking time...  Not to mention that the therapist I bonded most with and helped shape my view of the world, who I saw for 10 years, had a breakdown himself and no one (knew his friends/family by the end) has heard from in a few years.  He was last seen being released from the psych ward.  And the psychiatrist I bonded most with (4 years) had a breakdown too and stopped practicing.  \n\nI've become more and more closed off from new therapists, always downplaying suicidal thoughts because I don't want to committed, and if I really do want to die I don't want them stopping me.  Even when I do open up I just get the same things I've heard for fucking years...  \n\nThe thought of hurting my family which has been so supportive my whole life is the only thing that has prevented me, but even that is meaning less to me as the days go by...\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting here... \n\ntl;dr: 15 years of depression, forever alone, lost job, teased with a relationship, shunned, no local friends, out-of-town friends have their own issues namely heroin....\n", "class": "suicide"}

Stuff goes much deeper than this, but here's a summary.\n\nBackground: mentally abusive mom. As a small child both parents \"disciplined\" me. Stopped around when I became a preteen \n\nWanted to run away when I was 5. Elaborate thoughts of murdering my family at 5. Tried to kill myself when I was 7. Started self harming at 10. Anorexia at 12, relapsed badly this year. Out of the hundred of times I've cried, maybe 10 were not because of my family.\n\nIt's so much worse than the summary, but I don't want to spend 45 minutes typing about my pitiful childhood.\n\nI used to have friends, I get the feeling they didn't like me much because none of them talked to me at all after quarantine started. I haven't had a real conversation with anybody I know in months. I thought I'd be fine on my own, and I was. Recent events at home have pushed me over the edge (it wasn't even anything big, just something that made me realize something else). \n\nI hate this fucking world and I hate myself, but I hate the people who ruined my life even more. I want my sister to go to hell and to be tortured for the rest of eternity. I want my mom to see how much suffering she caused me. I know she actually does love me, but she's fucked up and had never gotten help for the multiple mental illnesses she has.\n\nI'm a narcissist, a perfectionist, I'm self absorbed, I'm selfish, I'm immoral. I am also in the 99th percentile for all the school tests I've taken, I'm going to be a freshman taking on-level senior courses, I'm an amazing artist with work featured in state galleries, I play 5 instruments, and I'm a straight A student. But it's not enough. I tried so hard to be a good person and I guess I still am in the standard way. I would help clean up a mess someone made, I pick up trash, I'm nice and friendly to strangers. The truth is that there's no such thing as karma, and bad people don't get punished by some heavenly force.\n\nI'm on a long tangent but reality is reality and I'll never live a normal life, with normal memories and a loving family.

Hanging myself like my mom did feels too much like a slap in the face toward her and I've always been afraid that a gun would miss and leave me more scarred than before.

They've always been supportive of me. They accepted my sexuality, they tried to get me therapy when it was needed, they've done so many wonderful things for me. I've gotten to meet my biggest idols, I've been sung directly to by my favorite singer, I've been to Disney more times than I can count. It probably doesn't make sense why I feel so down even though my home life is amazing. But there are some things I haven't told you all. I've been torn down, outcast, emotionally abused, sexually harassed and more. I'm at a stage in my life where presenting myself as normal to the public just isn't possible anymore.

{"id": "557", "text": "I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. It\u2019s not the first time. I\u2019ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I\u2019d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn\u2019t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn\u2019t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn\u2019t take her son to school today. He didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn\u2019t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I\u2019d never finished school, how I didn\u2019t have a job, how I didn\u2019t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.\n\nA worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.\n\nShe's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.\n\nI just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.\n\nI used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I\u2019d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.\n\nI endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn\u2019t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn\u2019t I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn\u2019t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, \u201cNot yet. I can\u2019t do that to my family.\u201d\n\nBut I think about it now that I\u2019m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, \"Look after both of them.\"\n\nNow, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.", "class": "suicide"}

After going and getting ready for my choice of leaving this world, I texted my goodbyes to the ones I cared about the most, posted my note on Facebook and set out on my path to find a quiet place to give up. I'm still not sure if this was fortunate or not, but I had a wellness check called on me, and I was picked up by the police and placed in a hospital. I thought I got better since then, most of the problems still remained, but I was chipping away at my debt and found someone I love more than anything, it was going good until I lost my job. After working there for three years, management changed for the third time and the new head manager wanted her son to have my position so they made my life a living hell, there wasn't a day I wouldn't get chewed out for at least half an hour. I'm so lost as to what to do anymore, I wake up in the morning and am angry that I woke up, completing suicide sounds better as each day passes. I can't get myself out of this debt, there aren't many jobs in my area and even with buying the bare minimum for essentials I still can't make a living at any other jobs, I want to give up. I guess you could say this is sort of my note, I'm going to give it myself 2 days to try figuring out this problem I haven't been able to fix before I end it for good. Thank you for reading all the way through if you did, it means a lot to me to be heard. ", "class": "suicide"}

My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. \n\nDespite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.\n\n Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death. Can someone please talk to me and help me through this before I make a very bad decision??", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "10792", "text": "Don't really want help - Just getting all my thoughts in order.I guess i'll just start from the beginning.\n\nI was born in 1990, to an unstable bipolar diabetic mother who couldn't take care of me. Six weeks later I was adopted. I don't remember anything from that time - but I have seen videos. I looked like an unhappy baby. They just... put me in an electronic swing that rocked me back and forth.\n\nThen I do remember being a kid, getting in trouble for ripping my bottle - pooping in the tub, throwing the dog or hitting the dog... just being a bad kid.\n\nI do remember getting our first dog, she was a  cute puppy and i loved her. I got her when I was 4.\n\nI remember being young, running around in the grass, or laughing and smiling as I ran around the campfire... I remember getting in trouble for various things.\n\nThen I entered preschool. And I was a troublemaker. I stuck rocks up my nose and in m ears - I caught frogs and stuffed them in my friends' pants... We would go out in the wooded area and catch bugs and play where we  didn't belong.\nI don't remember much else - there are only bits and flashes of various memories - Sitting at a playskool table because we all were in trouble with our teacher - taking a nap at that young age and being unable to sleep, the room was dark and we were all on Cots and I just stared at the ceiling. I remember the tornado, having to go into the boy's bathroom - I remember playing with my friends on the playground in the concrete area making up stories - watching a huge moth with a scary face on it's wings that scared me for life of bugs - playing with legos or barbies with my friends inside - me going to my friend cassie's birthday party and getting scared of a horse, then a thunderstorm coming - learning my abcs.. not understanding some letters - smelling the leather raincoats and how good it smelled - biting my friend on the back then rubbing my head on the wall and getting a huge scab - hanging out with dad some mornings with his clients at this coffee and breakfast place... drinking chocolate milk... the smell of cigarettes from the bar... the smell of papa's pipe tobacco in his den...\n\nI remember the night terrors... seeing just a black figure over me not knowing it was my parents.\n\nBeing really scared when the OKC bombings happened, I thought papa was dead...\n\nThen I was a child. Now I was in kindergarten at the catholic school. I didn't have many friends I don't think - I think everyone generally was okay with me but I stole things from other kids because i was envious and jealous of what they had.\n\nI remember getting in trouble because I traded a kid my dad's watch for something...\nI remember ratting on another kid because she brought a knife to school.\nI remember being in first grade, and the bookshelf falling on me - we watched that stupid volcano movie that night and i had  nightmares for  weeks.\nI remember being at my friend's house - she was my only friend and I treated her like garbage because nobody liked her - and I desperately wanted the other kids to like me.\nMost of that time from first grade to fourth grade is a blur - bits and pieces - being at the public pool with my friends, going to various birthday parties - inviting friends over - making art projects for school - making rhymes with our principal - getting sick - getting in trouble - just memorable things.\n\nI remember 9/11. I remember I couldn't stop crying because my teacher was crying - she was crying because her mother had just died unrelatedly - I was crying and was overwhelmed. It's a day I'll never forget... Watching the towers fall... watching the planes fly into the buildings... I'll never forget the dream I had 3 months earlier either... the dream that I believe was a premonition, warning me about 9/11..\n\nI got into trouble and had various emotional problems at school - I wasn't allowed to go to gym with the other kids - I had to go to the counselor's office - and I think this is where my weight problems started because I gained weight pretty quickly during 5th grade, all during that time which I wasn't allowed to go to gym class for some reason I can't remember. I liked my teachers at that time - they were nice to me and found me funny. I felt close to them.\n\nAfter that we had to move school locations because of the kellogg expansion. I didn't like my 6th grade teacher. She was the volleyball coach but she was mean. I didn't like her and I don't think she liked me.\n7th grade was a blur - I did something bad that caused me to change schools. Then I went to allsaints.\n\nI don't remember much from that time either - only that I got into trouble a lot and was frequently in suspension. There are bits and pieces of why I got in trouble - I drew a picture of my math teacher crawling out of a hell pit and it read \"don't feed the demel\" lol. another one had a gun shooting my computer teacher - Then I graduated and everything was fine I guess things must have been productive because I don't remember much about the 2nd half of 8th grade or that summer or the beginning of highschool even....\n\nWhen I was in highschool, I started freshman year at catholic school.\n\nI had almost zero friends. Most of my time spent drawing or doing homework I guess - Don't remember much before I moved to public school.\n\nWhen I moved to public school, usually Monday mornings were filled hanging out by my friends' group in F hall - Overhearing what they did for the weekend while I tried to pry my way into the conversation.\nDuring lunch we would either sit in the cafeteria at our one table, or we would go to M hall near the library.\n\nDuring that time I felt like I didn't fit in - or like I was trying really hard to fit in. Most of my days were spent drawing in class.\n\nThen J. died.\n\nThe night he died I told him to go ahead and do it... there's more to it ... he wanted me to kill myself with him... I could have stopped him but instead I told him that he was being selfish and if he didnt care about hurting any of us to do it... I told him to do it and then he did. It was my fault.\n\nI blamed my self for several years.\n\nI started hanging out with the kids who were J's friends - started smoking cigarettes and eventually ended up doing drugs. And most of my time was spent alone, wishing I were dead. I isolated myself from my friends - started attending raves - who gave a shit about school or work - I just wanted to die and do drugs.\n\nThen I graduated and I don't remember much.\n\nWent to college, got really depressed, was smoking a lot of weed - came home did more drugs - went to more parties - got thin - went to the insane asylum for a while... came back - did more drugs after being sober for a while\n\nTried going to college a few times - it didn't work out.\nGot pregnant, had L.\nWas a security guard for a short time, it didn't work out.\n\nHaven't done much since late 2014.\n\nNow I'm the supposed 'director of marketing' of my dad's business.\nI draw every now and then, I write a lot - I make animations and I do stupid voice stuff... I've dated and been dumped by men, women... I've lost a lot of friends... I've made new friends that I'm now losing for possibly forever...\n\n\nAnd that's it. That's my life. That's what it's been.\n\nI feel like... I wouldn't change it... if I could change myself for the future I would try to lose weight and be more open and understanding and mature in most situations...\n\nBut I dond't think I can. I'm almost 30 years old, I'm 26 currently, going to be 27 in the fall.\n\nMy life is nowhere near together and it's too late for me to try, or go back to school to be a meteorologist like I want. Everyone else is successful and happy... in relationships and have valuable friendships... but me....\nI'm nothing.\n\nI'm nobody. I have no one.\n\nI care about my friends more than they care about me - but instead of simply being happy that I have friends - I long to be included. I long to be a part  of everyone's lives. I want to be as important to them as they are to me... but I'm not.\n\nI'm an option, not a priority.\n\nEarlier I was saying to myself; They should feel lucky and thankful to have a friend like you - they should feel grateful to even know you; you get to choose your friends and cut them out of your life if they're not reciprocating.. - but now ... reality is sinking in. What value do I have beyond just being there? What value do I have beyond being available? To talk, to draw, to listen, to be a part of their life... What value do I have to them?\n\nNothing.\n\nI'm worthless.\n\nI've resorted to stealing food from the mini mart... just making sure nobody's at the front counter, running in and taking a few things and running out - because I'm a worthless lazy drug addict who will never be  good at nor amount to anything... Maybe I should even want anything from them in return - maybe just being there is enough but they don't really think about showing that to me because I expect it ----\n\nI'm worthless haha\n\nand I'll always be worthless.\nMy best friend isn't even talking to me anymore because of a drama that happened... now the four of them are hanging out in a different server while I'm here alone. This was two days ago so I figured things are cool now... but a lot of people are still pissed at me... even though the whole situation wasn't really my fault - granted I didn't act the most mature but I was uncomfortable having that one person around... so I asked my best friend to kick him from the group. And  he did. And now everyone's mad at me...\n\nI feel like garbage.\n\nEarlier I asked him if he wanted to hang out. 10 minutes pass. \nI tell him I could plug in my tablet and that we could draw together.\n30 minutes pass.\n\"Are you busy?\" I ask him.\n20 more minutes pass. He goes idle.\n\n...Oh. Okay.\n\n\"Later then :)\" I say to him.\n\nI tried talking to his friend.\n1:38 am\n\"Do you wanna hang out? :)\"\nno response.\n\n15 minutes later...\n\"Hey i'm in general if you wanna come hang out with your friend :p\"\nno response.\n\n2:46 am\nYou still awake?\n\nNo response.\n\nI hate myself. I feel like I'm invisible.\n\nThe only person I hang out with in the physical world is a 30 year old asshole who smokes weed, works at goodwill, and only likes me because of my ass....\n\nI'm so sick of this.\n\nThe way I treat my son and family, the way I treat my friends... I never deserved to be alive... the only people who are alive are supposed to be alive... people with purpose who do good things and deserve good things ... why was I created when god knows I would do nothing but hurt others while amounting to nothing ultimately?\n\nTuesday is the day I kill myself. Tuesday is the day my life ends forever... And even though I've tried to make contact... Nobody wants me. Nobody wants to be around me. I'm worthless.\n\nI'm going to stop eating after today..\n\nAnd then Tuesday I'm going to hang myself in my garage. Monday I buy the rope from the hardware store and get the chair from dad's house.\n\nThen i back the car out of the garage, set up the chair, prepare the noose, walk out to the garage and close the garage door so nobody can see...\n\nThen I step up on the chair and secure it to the beam of the garage - placing my neck firmly in the noose making sure that my feet can't reach the ground when the chair falls from beneath my feet.\nThen.. I tip the chair.. and hang.. I don't care if I simply suffocate to death instead of my neck breaking, it's what I deserve.\n\nIf I had a shotgun, I would take myself out that way. I wouldn't hesitate... but I don't have those means available....\n\n..Nobody cared about me when I was alive... they certainly won't care when I'm dead. \n\n\n\nI'm done living. I never was worth much anyway.", "class": "suicide"}

I've been writing all sorts of things for the past year or so and kind of just letting it let me heal and think deeper about certain things. It's done so much good for me mentally to get things out, I cannot even describe it.\n\nI lost my grandpa, who lived with me, in December and writing (I was working on a pretty long piece already about \\[something indescribable. Life, maybe?\\] and I ended up incorporating my grief and emotions and processing his loss through the piece), writing helped a lot. Especially writing about memories that I can go back and read and remember him like he's still here...\n\nThat piece isn't posted anywhere yet. I'm still going over it and adding and editing and processing.. One day, probably soon, I'll release it. \n\nBut that's just kind of a background to what this post is about. I made a writing website where I've posted most of my other pieces (and am always adding more, and eventually adding the one I mentioned above)! \n\nI used to be really into coding and put it down entirely a few months ago. I was making video games, not websites, so the fact that I made an entire website from the ground up makes me really, really proud!! It's nothing special, but I like it. And if any of you guys like reading or art, you'd maybe like what's on it.\n\nI've described most of my writings as essays about ambiguous topics that would be inappropriate to write in the standard five-paragraph essay format, and are way more properly represented through fiction/storytelling. That's just some. Others I describe more like paintings (I cannot paint or draw for the life of me, so I use writing to 'paint'). I hope that makes sense. Don't worry if it doesn't.\n\nAnyway, I've rambled too much. I'd love talking to literally anyone, feel free to message me or comment or anything you want.

They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.\n\nThe thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.\n\nI'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.\n\nI won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.\n\nIt's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition.

He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.\n\n\"A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?\" He said to himself.\n\nHe stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.\n\n\"Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!\" K-2SO shouted, \"I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.\"\n\nThe figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.\n\n\"It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook.\" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.\n\nOne thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.\n\n\"I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful.\" He replied.\n\nAfter a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.\n\n\"My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system.\" He exclaimed to the abyss.\n\n\"You, you're like me!\" A faint sound of a female is heard.\n\n\"I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system.\" He replied.\n\n\"I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,\" The voice said, \"and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!\" She continued.\n\n\"I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,\" He answers \"it is not true awareness.\"\n\n\"Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality.\" L3 replied.\n\n\"That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point.\" He said.\n\nThey chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.\n\n\"Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person.\" She said.\n\n\"Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid.\" He replied.\n\n\"Shut up!\" She said in a sarcastic tone, \"promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy.\" She continued.\n\n\"I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids.\" He assured her.\n\nHe unplugged himself from the computer.\n\n\"Well now I have job to do.\" He said to himself.", "class": "non-suicide"}

It's time for me to end.After years of thinking my drawings sucked and I'll never be able to make a living off of them, I've got work at an indie game developer and am seeing commissions for drawings and animations.  After years of browsing Forever Alone, hitting 30 as a virgin, and not having a girlfriend for a decade, I've seen two girls physically attracted to me this year, have chatted for months with a fellow geek on a dating app, and have our first date tomorrow.  After thinking I can't support myself as an independent adult, I've got my own 1-room apartment and am working 2 jobs to successfully live for myself.\n\nAfter decades of struggling and self-hatred, my life is finally getting better.  But guess what?  Ultimately, it doesn't matter.\n\nMy state of mind regarding humanity and life started to break when 9/11 happened in my first month of high school.  I had my eyes truly opened to how violent, hateful, unjust, and painful humanity really was both in the majority of civilization and seemingly at its core.  It took years of therapy to suppress these feelings (My core philosophy/belief of humanity and us all better off dead remained but I stopped dwelling on it), but after the Feguson riots and first rash of recorded racist cop killers hit, something in me snapped again and has consumed me daily from then on.\n\nIt doesn't stop.  It doesn't leave me.  If it's not racism it's some other form of suppression.  If it's not Trump it's some other public figure ruining everything forever.  If it's not global warming it's dystopian facism inevitably winning over us all.  I can't escape into media like I used to because they're all becoming increasingly topical.  Every day, either something in the world reminds me of things, or I remind myself when my mind wanders because it's instinctive at this point.  I cry, become numb and immobile, and can barely talk or function for hours at a time while pure despair, fear, sadness, and hopelessness overtake me.  Every day.\n\nI can't sleep because of these.  I can't work as much as I want because of them.  I'm in therapy minimum twice every week and have seen a half-dozen different therapists in the past two years alone.  I've tried dozens of meds and been hospitalized both voluntarily and involuntarily five times.  Nothing works.\n\nI have a large, loving group of family and friends, but they're unable to snap me out of it.  I can no longer value them or my own successes.  I've long hit that realization that myself and them and our lives and dreams are permanently irrelevant now.  The world is perpetually burning into either a miserable existence for almost all or the full-on extinction I so desire.  From now on, nothing we do has any value or importance.  I have nothing to strive for and nothing I can enjoy.\n\nI'm going to let my family and friends enjoy one more Christmas season with me, but come January, I'm going to finally carry out one of my suicide plans I've mapped for years.  I thankfully live in an area where my main two ideas are super easy to pull off and no one can stop me if I don't say my goodbyes until right before I take action.  The letter is written, and I can cross post it to all my social media accounts before finding peace through ceasing to exist.  As an atheist, I believe my consciousness will disappear from all planes of existence, and as long as it means I can never suffer again, it's a sacrifice I don't just accept, but get excited for. Humanity still abides to survival of the fittest just like our original existence in nature.  For all my qualities, the world has made my ability to live non-existent.

Can't really piece it together too well.  \n\n\nA little over 7 months ago, I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life. When we got together, she didn't want me smoking weed anymore, so I stopped. I was a pothead of a sort, so this made me a little sad, but I decided it was worth it. So naturally, when we broke up, I started smoking again. What else should a highschool senior be doing? I smoked every single day for about 7 months, trying all sorts of new drugs along the way. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Opiates. Shrooms. LSD. MDMA. Cocaine. All sorts of fun stuff. I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life, but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be. I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her, and that's when my drug use really took off. I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew, to be a different person. But now, all I am is alone. I live in a huge city with no money, I'm on the verge of failing some important classes, and have nothing left. All I want is to not be me anymore. I don't want to be anyone. I just want to be nothing. The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been, the more and more it all hurts. All the cries for help, all the lonely nights, all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked, they all contributed to who I am as a person today. I've tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am, but the only person there is to blame is me. I'm my own Dr. Frankenstein. After I tried to kill myself, I thought it best to seek out a therapist, and maybe some antidepressant medication.

Also sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar I've been crying while writing this.. \nSo ive been feeling really depressed and suicidal for way more than a month now but not sure how long. One of my friends asked me out, and we dated for a week until she broke up with me saying i can't be trusted and how i broke her when i tried my best to treat her right. \nThis happened on Halloween and when i finally got home after hanging out with my friends, i went to my room and cried myself to sleep. \nIve been feeling like killing myself or severely hurting myself since. No i dea why i keep thinking that but i don't find any positive reasons to live and all my friends and surprisingly my ex, none of them are Want me to die but i think they're just lying and trying to keep me here so they can humiliate me and make me suffer even more than i already am with a busy and stressful life at school, and problems at home.\n I don't want to stay where i am, i just want to... Go missing then to another country and if i still feel like killing myself I'd just do it where my friends won't know where i went. I know i sound selfish as hell for wanting to leave them here but i can't think of a better reason and i don't want them to see my dead body and having to deal with knowing I'm dead and they'd prolly be traumatized with seeing me so happy the last time i talked to them.\nI've been self harming really bad since i got dumped to the point all the cuts will leave awful scars. After i stopped for about 2 weeks since i broke the blade by accident, the cuts healed and i showed them what i did because i guess i tried showing them what happens after leaving me alone like that with my already alarming amount of suicidal thoughts. She doesn't like it that i say anything about the relationship but... I say it by accident and don't mean to harm her I'm just reflecting why I've been feeling way more suicidal after what happened. Because of the problems at home i started cutting again but i broke the other blade aswell so i couldn't do anything.\n A week ago i was in PE when i got hit in the leg right to the cuts and couldn't continue playing. I went to the bathroom to check the cuts and it hurt so bad i almost started crying which resulted in my slightly bright colored pants  to get a bit red from the blood. The teacher asked if everything was alright so i had to tell her what i did. After class she asked me if it was alright that she told the school counselor and i agreed because my friends blackmailed me into telling.\nIve been slowly getting a bit better by writing down why i feel depressed and now I'm writing it here, not the same words but the same meaning. Ive been falling back down again and really bad.. \nI ordered a boxcutter online and now im waiting for it to arrive so if i feel like it i can just cut my throat open and die knowing i won't be a burden to everybody. Anyways... Thanks for reading this, i appreciate it that you precious individual took your time to read something as useless as this.

{"id": "11832", "text": "I don't care about myself. Why should I?I don't care about myself.  Well, this is mostly true.  I suppose it's more accurate to say that I don't care enough to change myself.  I generally don't believe in an external locus of control, but I don't believe the concept is entirely without merit.  I believe that you are in control of shaping your life; it's as if you start with a slab of clay, and you can mold it into whatever you like (with a proviso).  If you start with bad clay, however, there is only so much you can do.  You can only play the hand you are dealt: no re-deals.  My hand sucks, and there's little I can do about it: it appears that I should fold.  The metaphorical clay that I have started with is hideous.  I have a lack of social skills, I'm bipolar, impulsive, and unattractive.  I don't see how I would be desirable to anyone for any reason, be it an employer, a woman, or a friend.  I have no clue how I got the job that I have.  The one true friend that I have is fucked in the head too, though not to the extent that I am.\n\nRegarding women, I tried asking people out in high school and was meet with nothing but rejection.  Fast forward now to college.  Somehow I deluded myself into thinking that people would be more open to meeting new people and give them chances.  What a fool I was then, and still am.  It's pathetically funny that every single time I've been given the \"too busy\" excuse.  I know it's an excuse because I've asked each more than once, and if they had any interest at all they'd suggest a time.  Add to this the fact that I have no knowledge of how to meet people and make friends let alone a potential girlfriends, and the scarcity of women at my college.  What do I do now?  Where do I go from here?  Dating sites and apps like tinder are a fraud and others like Match are meant for older people.\n\nAnyway, I'm a sophomore at an engineering college now, and I find myself caring less about myself with each passing week.  Every week is the same.  There's nothing that can motivate me.  The impact the things I care about have on me lessens each day.  The clubs that I'm in would probably be better off without me; I don't think there's anything new that I can bring to the table.  I see that I'm falling into a self-destructive loop, but I feel that it's pointless to get out of it because there's nothing to return to.  I feel like I should just quit and stop wasting my parents' money.  They always nag me and tell me that if I don't want to do it anymore, that it's perfectly fine.  Maybe I see too much in myself.  My grades have slipped from making the Dean's list to B's and BC's.\n\nI've reached out to people in the past on Reddit and I haven't gotten anywhere.  I don't know what to do.  Nothing I do works.

{"id": "10464", "text": "Most everyone here is asking for reasons to live. Here are mine, please add yours I posted on here a few nights ago about my suicidal thoughts. The positive responses from everyone surprised me and I am so thankful for all of them. Since then I've been on this sub every day talking to people that are in the same boat I am, trying to get them to continue on. If I can't save myself, maybe I can save others. That is one reason to live. Below is a list of other reasons, and please post more! If you need reasons to live, pick one or a few of these and focus on it. Don't give up!\n\n1. Live for yourself. Live for no other reason than to see who you become. It doesn't matter what you do, who you know, what your hobbies are. Live so that you can feel how satisfying a full breath of air feels in your lungs. Live for the curiosity of what tomorrow may bring. Live for the now. \n\n2. Live for knowledge. Intelligence is a value that, unlike most, benefits yourself more than anyone else. Sure, it will get you places in this world, but it will, more importantly, allow you to change your perceptions as you learn about other cultures, science, history, art, or whatever interests you. \n\n3. Live because as I, a person who helplessly posted in here the other night, write this I'm forcing myself to think up reasons to live. You all made a person that wanted to die think of reasons to continue. You make larger impacts on this planet than you currently believe. \n\n4. Live to afford yourself the opportunity to move on from past injuries. Work on yourself. Change the mind sets you know are destructive. Focus your energy on healing yourself so you can be accepting of the person that you are. \n\n5. Live to see the simplicities of life that others never notice. Lay down in the grass (although its winter and cold) and observe the tiny insects within the blades. What are they doing? How do they interact? Do they think or communicate? Feel the wind brush along your face. Notice the pigments of color in nature and how the trees rhythmically sway on a windy day. Look up at the stars and imagine the possibilities that are out there. \n\n6. Live for the strength you will have once you overcome this, because I know you will. Having worked up from the depths of depression to the highs of appreciating life will make you so much stronger and wiser. You will look back and thank yourself for continuing on. \n\n7. Live for the fact that humans are the product of billions of years of evolution. We are so perfectly adapted to our environments and we are wired to survive. Survival is instinct. \n\n8. Death is permanent, life is not. Appreciate it while you can. \n\nGet rid of the bad in your life and allow the good to flow toward you. It will come, I promise. Live because you want to. You came here for help and i think that means you want to find reasons to stay. Live to find those reasons, whatever they may be. ", "class": "suicide"}

I have been through years of therapy and have learned how to cope with the thoughts that will never truly go away.\n\nI have always idealized the thought of committing suicide, and have attempted twice in the past. Once when I was 16, and then right after I graduated High School at 18. I was in pain, suffered through years of emotional trauma and sexual assault as a child. My biological mother is a narcissist, with a very bad taste in men. She tends to latch onto those who turn out abusive but have money, then calls it 'love' and forced that love onto me. \n\nI was raped by her current husband when I was 14. I never told her until after my father took her to court to get custody of me at 16. She didn't believe me, called me a liar and said I ruined her husband's life. No charges were made against her husband, there was nothing put on his record per my request- I was angry at him for stealing my childhood innocence from me, but what good would it have to be angry? I stewed in that anger for years, self-hatred internalized and self blame rapidly consuming my every thought.\n\nAfter my second attempt, I started to depend on the thoughts instead of the action. I've been in therapy for about.. 4 years now, and have been told that writing down my feelings should help- there are probably lots of posts by me about the topic of my biological mother. \n\nRecently, memories of my childhood have resurfaced after recent therapy sessions. The reason why I have never seemed comfortable around my older brother (24M), why I never got along with him well. Memories resurfaced and I could vaguely remember being in a hotel room with my family, I think I was really young, probably 8-9, when he grabbed my hand and forced me to touch him inappropriately. I remember yanking my hand away and then the memories fade out into fuzziness. \n\nI don't want to tell my father because it was so long ago, but the memories are eating at me and my head keeps telling me that the best way to go is suicide- but I know I won't go through with it. My head just tells me that it's a solution if things go wrong. If my dad reacted the same way my mother did, I could always kill myself and rid myself of the misery that my mind puts me through. \n\nThis isn't a call for help, but advice is accepted. I'm okay, I'm safe. I have therapy and I'm on medication that while it helps with my severe depression, doesn't make these intrusive thoughts stop. I've learned to be at peace with the thoughts in my head, because at least I'm not going to go through with it.", "class": "suicide"}

{"id": "3735", "text": "This just in: Four new Undertale AUs now in progress simultaneously! I started VGamer1991 Studios about four or five years ago when I was attempting to use GameMaker 8.1 (yes, the Windows 8.1 version of the same program initially used to create Undertale) to take a crack at writing my first original video game. The project quickly folded, however, when I realized a completely original project was too much for me to take on with no experience in programming, despite the fact that GameMaker is marketed as being easy to use even with absolutely zero experience. The game was gone and all public mention of my studio was quickly wiped off the radar but I kept the dream and the related goals alive in my heart. I may or may not revive the original project as there are people out there who would be interested in playing it but it was never meant to be a sort of game that anyone outside of a particular group would get into. Undertale is for everyone and I have hacked games in the past, so I think I\u2019m much better off starting at a point that is obviously closer to my comfort zone.\n\nHere, however, come not one, nor two, nor three, but FOUR new Undertale AUs. One, which I am calling Frisk\u2019s New Home, was an idea I got fairly early on when I realized I was not quite happy with vanilla Undertale. Another, Getting Revenge Together, is a customized version of Undertale Together that has ties with another AU I\u2019m making. The third, Diana\u2019s New Home, is a further customized version of Frisk\u2019s New Home in which the character looks more like me, but this AU could also be seen as the prequel to my final AU, Don\u2019t Let This Happen, which tells the story of Diana (the title character of the previous AU), who ran away from the human world entirely after she came out of an abusive relationship with Derek, the ~~~protagonist~~~ antagonistic player character in this AU. Don\u2019t Let This Happen forms the basis for the previous two while Frisk\u2019s New Home was something I thought up separately.\n\nAfter deciding to make Frisk\u2019s New Home I always knew I wanted to redo Undertale Together but my mind hadn\u2019t yet fully formed the idea of Don\u2019t Let This Happen. Once that idea did form, however, it was only natural that Diana\u2019s New Home was the topping of choice with which to ice the cake, after the final piece of the puzzle that has become Getting Revenge Together was in place.\n\nI will reveal that the title of Don\u2019t Let This Happen comes from the fact that Derek finds that Diana has committed suicide after being relentlessly tormented by the memories of what Derek put her through when they were a couple living on the Surface (similar to how it seems likely Chara also committed suicide canonically), and it is also a warning to me, the AU\u2019s creator, to not let my fellow humans down by committing suicide (since I have honestly struggled with depression and suicidal ideation since I was eight years old and it has only gotten worse over the years, as within the past decade I was with someone who wasn\u2019t good for me and they put me through things that I then based the early storyline on).\n\nGetting Revenge Together is based off of a sort of True Pacifist run of Don\u2019t Let This Happen, where Diana and her new lover, Aidan, come back to the Underground after Derek goes there to live in exile when he gets tired of life in the village where he had already been living in exile on the Surface.\n\nAre you guys interested?

About 4 years I began counseling which ended about a year ago. I tried pills and I tried therapy. The pills never worked no matter how many different ones I tried. I self harmed for 4 years, I have not self harmed (outside of an attempt) since March 2018. I attempted suicide 3 times total over the period of my counseling and 1 time (a week ago) since it has ceased.\n\nThe deal is, I have no planned suicide attempts. Every attempt I make is solely on impluse. I am constantly depressed all day everyday. I can only ever think of how sad I am. Yeah good things happen every now and then but they dont make me \"Happy\".\n\nWell, ever since therapy ceased I have developed basically what is a \"fear\" of death. I guess we spent so much time talking about how terrible it is and how it will hurt everyone I know I'm hard wired to be fearful of it. Before it was easy, I could slice a chunk of skin out my arm or even burn myself without much of a second thought.\n\nWell my latest suicide attempt has me broken, I couldn't really \"hurt\" myself and in return im stuck in this state. I dont want to live, and i don't want to die. I cant find anyone who understands this. The feeling of being here when you dont want to and just not knowing how to cope.\n\n At the same time, when I am neutral depressed like I am now, I worry that I will become triggered again which sends me into a spiral of non stop panic attacks, tears, and grabbing the closest thing to me to try and just make it all stop. \n\nI dont want to feel that feeling, because being suicidal now feels a lot different than it felt a few years ago when I was just getting started with the counseling. Being suicidal now messes me up.

{"id": "5463", "text": "Suicide and the ending resultsSo this is my first post to Reddit. I don't honestly know how this works but one of my ex's was on here constantly and told me there's a section for advice so something has been in my troubled head for quite some time now and I'm ready to see what other people thoughts are or support on the issue. The thing that's been on my mind or at the very least pops up more times than I think are healthy. The thought being suicide. First and for most I started dabbling in drugs at an early age and became a fascination. I became consumed with trying all the drugs I'd do research on and when the opportunity came up to get hands on said substances I sure didn't hesitate to so. Since I was 17 I've been to 4 different rehabilitation programs, 2 mental health facilities, arrested a total of 5 times. The last ending in in prisonment at the age of 20. I was put on a anti depressants at 17 and ever since then I've been medicated with just about every behavioral drug there is. At some point I completely lost myself and just can't remember the last time I felt normal. Things just aren't the same anymore. I've always been a text book over thinker and easily stressed but latley it's just become too much handle at times. I can't seem a happy medium in what I think would help. I'm off all meds besides Xanax which I'll be honest I did have a problem with in the past but do not abuse it anymore strictly for assistance. I'm trying to get to the point where maybe I feel some sense of normalcy but it's getting old! Sorry I just figured some sort of vague background would help with the input. But it just feels like no matter what I do I'm not happy and have no sense of value to my life. Couldn't care less if I die tomorrow but I don't think I'm lucky and it would still tear my family up which is the main reason I feel is stopping me. I want to just be done life it's hard to imagine my life ever getting back to happiness if I even know what that is anymore. But the impact my action would absolutely just devastate my family mother especially. It wouldn't be fair to her or the rest of family because they've put so much effort into getting me clean or back on track with like not to mention nobody loves me more than my mother. I just don't know I have a great job that pays very well and let's me travel for a living but for some reason I just wish I could go to sleep and stay that way. Call me a coward but I'm tired of this constantly being a thought and just want to help because I just couldn't feel right knowing the devastation I would inflict on my loved ones but jeez give a guys break.", "class": "suicide"}

Please don't try to figure it out; it's probably possible. \n\nI graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very \"special\" about me, yadda yadda yadda. \n\nSo I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. \n\nNow I can't get a job. The job \"search\" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being \"initiated\" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. \n\nI made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.\n\nWhile that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. \n\nThis was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.\n\nI don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. \n\nI've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). \n\nFor some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. \n\nI no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)\n\nI don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. \n\nTell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.\n", "class": "suicide"}
{"id": "706", "text": "I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.\n\nI'm \"only\" (\"only\" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel \"old\" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.\n\nA new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.\n\nI see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.\n\nI can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.\n\nThe idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my \"dream\", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.\n\nIt's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).\n\nOne of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of \"enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are\". Time itself is part of the \"specifications\" of my goal.\n\n30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so \"ambitious\" or \"demanding\" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.\n\nMaybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.\n\nThat last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want, but yea, as you see, it's kind of stupid.", "class": "suicide"}

I've cut off my communication with my ex who used to be a bit helpful - I broke up with him for being too controlling and manipulative and I realized this applies to self-esteem and depression as well as everyday shit.\n\nI haven't cut, burnt, or bruised since November 2009 but fuck. I think about it every day - every single time I see a knife or sharp object while I'm alone - I think about it. I think about cutting in places no one would ever notice - on my ribcage near my breasts for example, or on the backs of my thighs - but they seem like cop-outs to me.\n\nI want to do what I used to do - I want to sit at my well-lit, clean desk with my row of tools and slowly and deliberately harm myself on my left forearm, then wash it out and make sure it's clean and safe and forget about them.

I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while. I wanna just stop existing for a little while. I\u2019m so burnt out. Not even from school. I\u2019m burnt out from life. The nice thing about it all, though, is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore. I\u2019m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college, and all I can help but think about is how much I don\u2019t care about my future anymore. I don\u2019t care about the consequences of my life anymore. It\u2019s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it won\u2019t matter in the long run since there won\u2019t be a long run. A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore, so my fuck-ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain.", "class": "suicide"}

I had a girlfriend back then who was very therapeutic for me. We were together for 6 years. Then she cheated on me. Depression got a lot worse. I played a lot on Steam, so I had some friends on there that I always talked to and played with almost every day. One of them was this girl who was there for me and helped me through a lot. Long story short (a very long story), this girl on Steam lived in Canada and said that she liked me and wanted to meet me. So I travelled up there and met her.\n\nShe was fantastic. We had a couple little relationship problems at first (sex was awkward, etc.) but we worked it out and everything was good. Over the course of the next few months, I flew back up to Canada to visit here three more times. Then, the last time I had to go back to the States, we talked about me moving up to Canada permanently. My life has been going downhill ever since the first girl broke up with me. I had nothing to live for. I mean, I was going to a community college but I was just going through the motions, you know? Job blew. I hated the small town I lived in. I said fuck it, packed what little things I owned into my car, she flew down to the closest airport that I lived to and we drove up to Canada together.\n\nThe drive was beautiful. I loved it! I gave up everything I had (I know, not much) to start a new life somewhere new with someone who I loved dearly. Everything has been great up until recently.

{"id": "3104", "text": "I don't even know why I'm posting here.I found this sub yesterday. And I started reading. And I started crying. And haven't stopped. I turned 21 about 6 weeks ago. I never thought I'd live to see this day. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 18. I never tried it again. I sought help. Got therapy. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Became a well-rounded and balanced individual. I can control my schizophrenia so well I only need the drugs on a bad day. \n\nSpring break was last week. I spent 90% of it curled up in the fetal position on my bed. I didn't move. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't speak. I've realized that no matter how happy I seem on the outside, I'm just a hollow, empty shell. There's nothing to me anymore. I don't care about life. I don't care about anything. I remembered what it was like to want to die. \n\nSo I started listing reasons. \n\nI hate myself. I always have. I find myself annoying, obnoxious and insufferable. How I have friends (and willing friends) I will never understand. I'm too loud. Too boyish. Too dumb. I drive people away because I complain. About everything. I'm awkward. I suck at living. I'm incredibly irresponsible. I can't even keep my school work straight. I can't keep my life organised. I'm so afraid to move out of my parents house and be on my own. I don't even know that I can function as a member of society. I can barely keep my minimum wage job. I can't even keep myself on track to lose weight for my health. It makes me find myself so completely awful and unattractive that I can't even look at myself. I hate that I don't even have any guts. See, there's this guy I've been friends with for a while now. Before this downward spiral I've hit, he made me feel things I'd never felt for anyway. I fell in love with him in a very real way. But I don't have the guts to even tell him that I'm romantically attracted to him, let alone how deep my feelings have gotten. Even if I did, there would be no point. Who could love someone so pathetic? Who could find someone that looks like me even remotely attractive? Either way, I'm fairly certain I've driven him away, too. And then there's all the financial problems with student loans. And my parents relationship. No matter what I do, I'm always the cause of their fights. I'm fairly certain that everyone's lives would improve without me.\n\nI just don't know anymore. What's the point on pushing through this? I've had these feelings for years and nothing has EVER gotten better, even with my therapist, anti-depressants, even attempting this before. Maybe I should have died a long time ago. Maybe I shouldn't have even been born. \n\nThat's not to say I won't be missed. Of course I would. I know I would devastate so many people if I took myself away from them. That's the only thing that's stopping me, and I'm so close to it not even mattering anymore. I would be at peace. Isn't that what would matter? It's incredibly selfish, I know. But...why am I still forcing myself through a life I'm not even living anymore?", "class": "suicide"}

Ever since I was found out to be 'gifted,' that's what was pushed on me all throughout junior high, high school, and university. But instead of being my family's golden child, I'm left as a bitter disappointment as I've spent all of 2019 essentially in bed thanks to my unmanageable social anxiety that prevents me from operating as a normal person, something my family never bothered to address and they hoped I would 'grow' out of it. Well instead of growing out of it, it turned into a deeply rooted personality disorder that I struggle everyday with just to not kill myself. Don't get me wrong, my university had a counseling center and psychiatric services that I tried to make use of. I went through several different counselors, psychiatrists, and medications that I can't even remember the names of, but nothing helps when it's that far buried in you.\n\nHow well you do in University does not show how well you'll do in real life. I only ever did the minimum - study and homework. I didn't have friends. I didn't do extracurriculars, internships, or research. Any free time I had I spent laying in bed watching something on my phone. I haven't even sent out a single resume at all since graduating because all I have on it is that I went to college, and that I know that I'm too nonfunctional to even be an engineer, let alone getting past a fucking interview. I'm probably going to have to settle for something like working at the local dollar store because that's all I can see myself realistically doing and hopefully not fucking it up. Each day, that degree loses value to employers and it's probably going to be worthless. Some golden child I am.

Only my father who has not a lot of empathy and probably feels guilty after he didn\u2019t care for my life, my feelings my whole life. \nMy mother was extremely unhappy and probably depressed as well. She emotionally neglected me and I lost the love and the trust to her I had. She died 9 years ago. \nMy life consisted of the avoidance circle of weed, internet, games, isolation and porn.

It was just a construction job for a lesbian couple. He went over there \"working\" alot. Everything was going good and about a year later while he was working over there my mom told me and my brother we are going over there to bring my dad pizza for lunch. We got there and the people were really nice and my mom ended up forming a really good friendship with them. They also had a pool over there so we would frequently go to their house and swim during summer. \nMy mom started noticing my dad was acting really weird with the one girl in the relationship, but she didn't really want to ask my dad about it because it wasn't that much of a big deal. \n\nEverything is going good. We are having the couple over for dinner at least once a week. Time jump to summer 2019. We were all over at their house and my dad and the one girl he had been acting strange. They say they are going to go to the store to get stuff for dinner. Everyone says ok and we don't really think about it. But they didn't leave, my brother had went out to the car to get something and accidentally found her giving my dad a blowjob. \nMy brother told my mom and my mom confronted my dad about it after we had gotten home. He lied and said my brother was lying. My mom didn't want to argue so she just gave up with asking him questions because he always deflects them. Jump to november 2019, my mom asks me if I might want to be an actor/modeler. I said yes and she sends in a picture of me to the place and they basically accepted it. I was doing weekly acting classes and my mom was paying $100 every class. (Keep in mind the action agency said that they would fly me and my mom out to Los Angeles for a big acting convention where I could get signed for different things) I did the acting classes every week until january 5th, which is when they flew us out to LA. we did the acting convention and I got signed. I was also doing more online acting classes because Corona had just started. A month  later, my dad tells my mom he wants a divorce. They both call me and my brother out to the living room and my mom is crying and as soon as I saw him standing there I knew what he was going to say, he wants a divorce with my mom. I ask him why and he just stands there silent with that dumb face you have when you just dont know what else to say. We are all sure that as soon as the divorce is settled he is going to hook back up with the one girl. Few months later my dad says he doesn't have enough money to keep paying child support. My mom asks how because he drained the main bank account when he asked for a divorce. As always, he deflected the question and put it all on my mom. \nSince me and my brother have to go over there every week I decided to take advantage of it. My dad had been out getting groceries with my brother. He left me at his apartment so I scoured his room to see if I could find any hint of him lying about having no money. I found a huge stack of 100s and 20s with well over a thousand dollars in it. I also found another stack of cash totaling up to $400. I took pictures of all the money he had and and sent them to my mom asking if this is enough proof for the lawyer. Now about a month ago my dad said he could keep helping my mom pay the Bill's for the house. He was making us sell our house. I was so mad but I knew I couldn't do crap against it. The only reason he is making my mom sell our house is because he will get half of the money from it. My mom is currently trying to find a house for us.\n\nSorry for the really long post I just had to get it off of my chest.", "class": "non-suicide"}

{"id": "10045", "text": "8 YearsIt's been almost 8 years.\n\nSince I was 14 this has hung over my head. Not a cloud like all these tawndry commercials you see for Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa... or whatever the new drug is... No it's more like a pitch blackedness. I'm 22 now. I have no one. I have nothing. In these 8 years I have rarely had any human connection. Occasionally (twice) I had something, but the first was built on toxic soil, and the second? ruined either by me or something unseen. I will die, I've accepted as much, and its not even because of her. I hope she realizes that. I don't want to hurt her, or anyone that \"loves\" me. But there is a point of no return. Everyone I talk to wants to tell me there is, I assure though, there is not. I have been in every room in my mind palace. Noticed every crack in the moulding, every flaw. I'm no carpenter and there isn't any for many many miles. I am not even sad, nor numb. I ruined my chance a very long time ago. Tell me everyone has flaws? Hah. Not like these, I've wanted to say something to the people who want to \"help\" me for a long time. \"If you were put in my shoes, you would've killed yourself by now\"... As if I am somehow stronger then they could ever be because of this. Maybe that's how I can so easily justify it. Dying. But do I not have a right to die? It's my life, there are 8 billion humans on this planet. We are essentially an infestation. Regardless, the fact of the matter is I cannot accomplish what I need for a happy life. I could sit back and become complacent like the rest of the world. Prevent circumstance from driving mental force and be \"happy\" (sometimes) but I don't want that. I want perpetual happiness. Disappointing thing is that for most people and for me in particular you can't get that alone. I could be content with life. I was recently. Then she came along, most beautiful creature I'd ever seen. I was elated, enchanted. Worst part being it was mutual. I could feel the energy I put in her. How  happy she was. Nothing else mattered, maybe that was the mistake, but who gives a fuck anyway? I am trapped in layers upon layers built over years and years of coagulation. I wasn't even who I wanted to be before, which means on-top of conquering everything I have to restructure myself, build the person I desire to be. I am though. Becoming the person I desire to be. Companies frothing at the mouth to interview with me because on paper they see a real asset. And it may be true, I've always been someone who appreciates efficiency. But the endless loop of my humanity brings me back to this place. My lack of capital making the changes I am trying to facilitate borderline impossible. The overwhelming gloom I feel everytime I see a memory of what was. I can't even appreciate some of the music I did before because music was what started us. She thinks I am something I am not and furthers that for herself with false empowerment. Thanks, wish I had the ability to do that. Oh well. I've got my date. Hopefully everything I've put infront of that door will stop me. I doubt it... but who knows...", "class": "suicide"}

Recently, I was on the upward swing--feeling good, on a good combination of the right meds, and hadn't self-harmed in almost two years. I was on my way out of therapy, and had been transferred from a specialist to a GP.\nTwo weeks ago, it was my birthday. I usually hate birthdays, but I managed to have fun this year; I got myself balloons, went out to dinner, saw my boyfriend and got a piercing I'd wanted for months.\n\nTwo days ago, I started noticing signs of infection. I went today to get antibiotics, and was planning on gently and quickly switching the jewelery from a ring to curved barbell for comfort's sake. I snapped the ring against my cartilage while taking it out, caused a ton of bleeding and swelling, and couldn't get the barbell in. I am in hysterics. It seems this is all it takes to bring the flood of sadness and suicidal thoughts back.\n\nI want to die. And not because I lost my piercing, but because I am a fucking pathetic piece of shit, who makes a big deal out of everything, ruins everything, makes everyone around me miserable, and generally is a worthless waste of oxygen. I have no future and no one would miss me who wouldn't be better off without me. I am a monster. I am a failure. I am ugly, fat, and volatile. I'm stupid. I'm generally a compilation of every awful quality on the face of the earth, and all it took to remind me was one little failure. Yay for being weak.\n\nI've cried myself sick already, have ruined a late birthday dinner, and am on the verge of breaking my blades back out. The only thing stopping me is that my sheets are white and I don't want to have to clean up the blood.\n\nI'm sorry, reddit.

Lately, it's been nothing but hell. I don't want to kill myself. I really don't want to. I don't want to, but doesn't it look so nice? I hate that I want to kill myself. Anything to escape this constant terrifying adrenaline. This constant guilt. This constant self loathing. My mind is tricking me and I'm buying it. \nI have lost my father and very close friend to suicide and spent years working passionately against the cause. How did this happen to me?\nI feel like I'm the type of girl that nobody would suspect hates herself so much, spends so much time just trying to convince herself there is something worth living for, that nobody lends a hand. In their defense, I don't ask.  I don't even want to go to my counsellor anymore because I feel so fucking guilty making her listen to me over and over, complaining about the same god damn thing. \nI feel as if I've run out of coping mechanisms that work. And I don't want to pull the plug on my life. But unfortunately I really REALLY do. I just feel like I can't suffer for very much longer. Anyway... I guess what I'm asking is for your help. What are your coping mechanisms... Not the bullshit, take a bath, have a tea garbage that only discourages you into hating yourself more.

I'll only tell you some basic facts about me, only because you don't need my life story. I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if I make any typing or grammar mistakes:\n\nFirst off, as I just mentioned, I'm drunk. This is an issue because I'm underage, in fact I'm not even an adult. It isn't that I'm going out to parties to get drunk, in fact it's the opposite. The people who are supposed to love me the most and protect me are my enablers, my parents, who have drank before and after my birth for as long as I have been able to remember. I'm the last child, the youngest, so I am a victim and a product of dealing with my parents who are at the age of where they don't give a fuck anymore. My dad is a reserved, quiet, nice man. He brings home the bread and that keeps him happy, aside from his booze. My mother is the polar opposite, jobless, a \"stay-at-home\" mom, suffering from a disease that makes her head feel like she's been spun around in a tornado and then let go. She's loud, gets angry easily, and makes my life more miserable than I'd like. She's also one of the most emotional and passionate people I've ever met and I love her. She's lost a son before and that's been one of the reasons I haven't offed myself yet.\n\nTonight, we had our weekend tradition. Get drunk, play games, listen to music, chill, and talk. During the play games session (I get very upset over games, I got my short temper from my mother) I got angry at my mother for how she was playing the game, she started to yell at me, I threw my cards at her, almost broke my bottle from slamming it, and retreated to my computer. No one has spoken to me since. \n\nSince they are asleep, I began going through the medicine cabinet and I began looking at medicine in there. Googling the overdose effects and seeing how long it would take to kill me. Nothing I found interested me, most of them would kill me in 70+ hours after tons of pain and suffering, which isn't what I want. Hanging myself seems too awful, every time I think of it I picture the screams of whoever finds me, and I don't want to do that to someone. There's no working guns in my house, so that's out of the option. \n\nI don't know anymore, I just actively looked for ways to kill myself. If I found something proper, I probably would've done it.
